<p class="ph2">IN THE NAME OF A WOMAN</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


<small>A NIGHT ADVENTURE IN SOFIA</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Help!</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The cry, faint but strenuous, in a woman&#8217;s voice,
rang out on the heavy hot night air, and told me that
one of those abominable deeds that were so rife in the
lawless Bulgarian capital was in progress, and I hastened
forward in angry perplexity trying to locate the
sound.</p>

<p>I knew what it meant. I had been strolling late
through the hot, close streets between the Park and
the Cathedral, when a woman closely hooded had
hurried past me, dogged by a couple of skulking, scuttling
spies, and I had turned to follow them. Across
the broad Cathedral Square I had lost sight of them,
and, taking at random one of the streets on the opposite
side of the square, I was walking and listening for
some sound to guide me in their direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help!&#8221; came the cry again, this time close to me
from behind a pair of large wooden gates, one of
which stood ajar. I pushed it open and crossed the
courtyard before a large house, loosening as I ran the
blade of the sword-stick I carried. The house was in
darkness in the front, and as I dashed round to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
back the cry was uttered for the third time, while I
caught the sounds of struggling.</p>

<p>There was a light in one of the lower rooms, the
long casement window of which stood partly open,
and the beams came straggling in a thin line between
some nearly closed curtains. With a spring I caught
the ledge, and, drawing up my head level with the
window, looked in.</p>

<p>What I saw told me that my worst fears were being
realised. The woman who had passed me in the street
was struggling with frantic effort to hold the door of
the room against someone who was fighting to get in.
Her cloak was off, and her head and face uncovered.
She was a tall, lithe, strenuous creature, obviously of
great strength and determination, and the whiteness
of the face, now set and resolute, was thrown up into
the strongest contrast by a mass of bright red hair,
some of which the fierceness of the struggle had
loosened. She was striving and straining with enormous
energy, despite the fact that she was bleeding
badly from a wound somewhere in the shoulder or
upper arm.</p>

<p>As I glanced in, she turned her head in my direction
with the look of a tigress at bay; and I guessed that
she was calculating the possibilities of escape by
means of the window. But the momentary relaxation
of her resistance gave the men a better chance, and,
to my horror, I saw one of them get his arm in and
slash and thrust at her with his knife.</p>

<p>She answered with a greater effort of her own, however,
and succeeded in jamming the man&#8217;s arm between
the door and the lintel, making him cry out with an
oath that reached me.</p>

<p>But so unequal a struggle could only end in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
way, and that very speedily unless I intervened; so I
scrambled on to the window ledge, and with a cry
leapt into the room. At the noise of my appearance,
mistaking me no doubt for a third ruffian come to
attack her, the woman&#8217;s courage gave out; she uttered
a cry of despair and rushed away to a corner of the
room. She released the door so suddenly that the two
men came staggering and blundering into the room,
almost falling, and I recognised them as the two
rascals I had seen following her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fear, madame; I am here to help you,&#8221; I
said, and, before the two ruffians had recovered from
the surprise of my appearance, I was upon them. One
could not stop his rush till he was close to me, and,
having him at this disadvantage, I crashed my fist into
his face with a tremendous blow, knocking him down
with such force that his head fell with a heavy thud
against the floor, and his dagger flew out of his hand
and spun clattering across the room almost to the feet
of the woman.</p>

<p>The second was more wary, but in a trice I whipped
out my sword, held him at bay, and vowed in stern,
ringing tones that I would run him through the body
if he wasn&#8217;t outside the room in a brace of seconds.
I saw him flinch. He had no stomach for this kind of
fight, and he was giving way before me when a cry
from the man I had knocked down drew our attention.</p>

<p>The woman, seeing her chance, had picked up the
rascal&#8217;s dagger, and with the light of murder in her
eyes, was stealing upon the fallen man.</p>

<p>Instantly I sprang between her and him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, madame; no bloodshed!&#8221; I cried to her;
and then to the men, &#8220;Be off, while your skins are
whole!&#8221; The words were not out of my lips before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
the unarmed man had already reached the door in full
flight, and his companion, seeing I meant to act only
on the defensive, and recognising the uselessness of
any further attack, followed him, though less precipitately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you stop me killing such a brute?&#8221; cried
the woman angrily, her eyes blazing. &#8220;They both
meant to murder me, and would have done it if you
had not come. They had earned death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I did not come to play the butcher,&#8221; I answered
somewhat sternly, repelled by her indifference
to bloodshed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow them and kill them now!&#8221; she cried vindictively.
&#8220;Do you hear? Kill them before they
carry the story of this rescue to their masters;&#8221; and
in her frenzy she took hold of my arm and shook it,
urging me toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better see to your wound,&#8221; I returned, as I sheathed
my sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah, you are mad! I have no patience with you!&#8221;
She shrugged her shoulders as though I were little
better than a contemptible coward, and walked to the
end of the room and stood in the lamplight half turned
away from me.</p>

<p>The pose revealed to me the full majestic grace of
her form, while the profile of her face, as thrown into
half shadow by the rather dim light of the room, set
me wondering. It was not a beautiful face. The features,
nose and mouth especially, were too large, the
cheek bones too high, the colour too pale; but it was a
face full of such power and strength and resource that
it compelled your admiration and silenced your critical
judgment. A woman to be remarked anywhere.</p>

<p>But when she turned her eyes upon me a moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
later, they seemed to rivet me with an indescribable
and irresistible fascination. In striking contrast to
the rich red hair and the pale skin, the eyes were as
black as night. The iris almost as dark as the pupil,
the white opalescent in its clearness, and fringed with
lashes and brows of deep brown. She caught my gaze
on her, and held it with a look so intense that I could
scarcely turn away.</p>

<p>Her bosom was heaving, and her breath coming and
going quickly with her exertions and excitement, and
after a moment, without saying a word, she threw
herself into a low chair and hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Who could she be? That she was a woman of station
was manifest. The richness of her dress, the appointments
of the room, told this plainly, even if her
mien and carriage had not proclaimed it; and yet she
seemed alone in the house. It was a position of considerable
embarrassment, and for the moment I did
not know what to do.</p>

<p>I had no wish to be mixed up in any such intrigue
as was clearly at the bottom of this business; and
though I was glad to have saved her life, I was anxious
to be gone before any further developments should
involve me in unpleasant consequences.</p>

<p>There was no more dangerous hornet&#8217;s nest of intrigue
and conspiracy than Sofia to be found in Europe
at that time, and the secret mission which had
brought me to the city about a fortnight before was
more than enough to tax all my energies and power,
without any such additional complication as this adventure
seemed to promise. My object was to get to
the bottom of the secret machinations by which Russia
was endeavouring to close her grip of iron on the throne
and country of Bulgaria, and, if possible, thwart them;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
and I had been trying and testing by every secret
means at my command to find a path that would lead
me to my end. It must be a delicate and dangerous
task enough under the best auspices, but if I were to be
embarrassed now by the coils of any private vengeance
feud, I ran a good chance of being baffled completely.</p>

<p>Even before this night the difficulties in my way had
appeared as hopeless as the perils were inevitable; and
I had felt as a man might feel who had resolved to
stay the progress of a railway train by laying his head
on the metals. But if this affair were as deadly as it
seemed, I might find my head struck off before even
the train came in sight.</p>

<p>Yet to leave such a woman in this helpless plight
was the act of a coward, and not to be thought of for
a moment; and I stood looking at her in sheer perplexity
and indecision.</p>

<p>She lay back in her seat for some minutes, making
no attempt to call assistance, not even taking her hands
from her face, and paying no heed whatever to her
wound, the blood from which had stained her dress.</p>

<p>I roused myself at length, and, feeling the sheer necessity
of doing something, went to the door and called
loudly for the servants.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is useless to call; there is no one in the house,&#8221;
she said, her voice now trembling slightly; and with a
deep sigh she rose from her chair, and after a moment&#8217;s
pause crossed the room to me. She fixed her eyes
upon my face; her look had changed from that of the
vengeful Fury who had repelled me with her violent
recklessness of passion to one of ineffable sweetness,
tenderness, and gratitude. Out of her eyes had died
down all the wildness, and what remained charmed
and thrilled me, until I felt myself almost constrained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
to throw myself at her feet in eagerness to do whatever
she bade me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will think me an ingrate, or a miser of my
thanks, sir,&#8221; she said in a tone rich and soft; &#8220;and yet,
believe me, my heart is full of gratitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please say no more,&#8221; I replied, with a wave of the
hand; &#8220;but tell me, can I be of any further service?
Your wound&mdash;can I not get you assistance?&#8221;</p>

<p>She paid no heed to the question, but remained
gazing steadfastly into my eyes. Then her face broke
into a smile that transfigured it until it seemed to glow
with a quite radiant beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, you can serve me&mdash;if you will; but
not only in the manner you think. The servants have
deserted the house. I am alone to-night&mdash;alone and
quite in your power.&#8221; She lingered on the words,
paused, and then added: &#8220;But in the power of a man
of honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I serve you? You have but to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could think that,&#8221; was the quick answer,
with a flash from her eyes. &#8220;But first for this,&#8221; and
she rapidly bared the wound, revealing an arm and
shoulder of surpassing beauty of form. &#8220;Can you
bind this up?&#8221; For the moment I was amazed at this
complete abandonment of all usual womanly reserve.
The action was deliberate, however, and I read it as at
once a sign of her trust and confidence in me, and a
test of my honour. The hurt was not serious. The
man&#8217;s blade had pierced the soft white flesh of the
shoulder, but had not penetrated deep; and I had
no difficulty in staunching the blood and binding
it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a serious wound,&#8221; I said reassuringly. &#8220;I
am glad.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>&#8220;That is no fault of the dastard who struck at me.
It was aimed at my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>She showed not the least embarrassment, but appeared
bent on making me feel that she trusted me as
implicitly as a child. When I had bound up the
wound she resumed her dress, taking care to put the
stains of blood out of sight; and then, with a few
swift, graceful movements, for all the stiffness of the
hurt, she coiled up the loose tresses of her hair.</p>

<p>When she had finished she went to a cabinet, and,
taking wine and glasses, filled them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will pledge me?&#8221; and she looked the invitation.
&#8220;We women are so weak. I am beginning to feel
the reaction.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was putting the glass to my lips when she stopped
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay, I wish to know to whom I owe my life?&#8221;</p>

<p>So powerful was the strange influence she exerted
that I was on the point of blurting out the truth, that
I was Gerald Winthrop, an Englishman, when I
steadied my scrambled wits, and, mindful of my secret
mission in the country and of the part I was playing,
I replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the Count Benderoff, of Radova.&#8221;</p>

<p>She saw the hesitation, but put it down to a momentary
reluctance to disclose my identity, for she
answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not repent having trusted me with your
name, Count.&#8221; Then, with a flashing, subtle underglance,
she added, &#8220;And do you know me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As yet, madame, I have not that honour, to my
regret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet I am not unknown in Bulgaria,&#8221; and she raised
her head with a gesture of infinite pride.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>&#8220;I am a stranger in Sofia,&#8221; said I, in excuse of my
ignorance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even strangers know of the staunch woman-friend
of his Highness the Prince. I am the Countess Anna
Bokara.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew her well enough by repute, and her presence
in the house alone and defenceless was the more
mystifying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to wish you a speedy recovery from
your wound, Countess,&#8221; and to cover the thoughts
which her words started I raised my glass. She seemed
almost to caress me with her eyes and voice as she
replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I drink to my newest friend, that rare thing in this
distracted country, a man of honour, the Count Benderoff,
of Radova.&#8221; As she set her glass down she
added: &#8220;My enemies have done me a splendid service,
Count&mdash;they have brought me your friendship. They
could not have made us a nobler or more timely gift.
The Prince has need of such a man as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bowed but did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a stranger here, you say. May I ask your
purpose in coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in search of a career.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can promise you that,&#8221; she cried swiftly, with
manifest pleasure. &#8220;I can promise you that certainly,
if you will serve his Highness as bravely as you have
served me to-night. You must not think, because you
see me here, seemingly alone and helpless, that I have
lost my influence and power in the country. My
enemies have done this&mdash;Russia through the vile agents
she sends here to wound this distracted country to the
death&mdash;suborning all that is honourable, debasing all
that is pure, undermining all that is patriotic, lying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
slandering, scheming, wrecking, destroying, working
all and any evil, bloodshed, and horror, to serve the
one end ever in their eyes&mdash;the subjugation of this
wretched people. My God! that such injustice should
be wrought!&#8221;</p>

<p>The fire and passion flamed in her face as she spoke
with rapid vehemence.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is by such men as you that this can best be
thwarted&mdash;can only be thwarted. I tell you, Count,
the Prince has need of such men as you. Pledge me
now that you will join him and&mdash;and me. You have
seen here to-night the lengths to which these villains
would go. Because of my influence with the Prince,
and in opposition to Russia, I have been lured here
by a lying message; lured to be murdered in cold
blood, as you saw. You saved my life; I have put
my honour in your hands; you have offered to serve
me. You are a brave, true, honourable man. You
must be with us!&#8221; she cried vehemently. &#8220;Give me
your word&mdash;nay, you have given it, and I can claim it.
You will not desert me. Make the cause of truth and
honour yours, and tell me that my Prince and I may
rely on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She set me on fire with her words and glances of
appeal, and at the close she laid her hands on mine,
until I was thrilled by the infection of her enthusiasm,
while her eyes sought mine, and she seemed to hunger
for the words of consent for which she waited.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>&#8220;NOW YOU WILL HAVE TO JOIN US&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tempting</span> as the offer was which my strange companion
made me, I could not bring myself to accept it
without time for consideration, and my hesitation in
replying irritated and seemed to anger her.</p>

<p>She thrust my hands away from her with petulant
quickness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a man of strangely deliberate discretion,
Count,&#8221; she said as she turned away to the end of the
room and threw herself into her chair again, from which
she regarded me with a glance half scornful, half entreating.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I do not accept at once, believe me it is from
no lack of appreciation of the honour you offer me or
the charm with which it is offered, but circumstances
compel me to be deliberate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Circumstances?&#8221; she cried, with a shrug of disdain
and disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret that I cannot explain them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not, without telling her the whole reason of
my presence in Sofia; and that was of course impossible.
My secret commission was from the British
Government, and the intrigue which I had to try and
defeat was designed to depose her Prince, and set on
the throne in his place a woman who would be a mere
tool in the hands of Russia.</p>

<p>I am half a Roumanian by birth, my father having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
married the Countess of Radova, and my childhood
had been spent in the Balkan peninsula. It was on
one of my visits to the estates in Radova that I had
come across the scent of this newest Russian intrigue,
and as I had already had close communications with
the British Foreign Office and accepted one or two
missions of a secret character, I had volunteered for
this, believing that single-handed I could effect secretly
much more than could be done by the ordinary machinery
of diplomacy. The Balkan States were in a condition
of ferment and unrest; the war between
Bulgaria and Servia had ended not long previously;
Russia was keenly bent upon rendering her influence
impregnable; and as no other European Government
would interfere, our Foreign Office was loath to take
open measures.</p>

<p>At such a juncture my services were readily accepted,
and I had arrived in Sofia a couple of weeks before,
and was just forming my plans, when this startling
incident had occurred.</p>

<p>I had stipulated for a perfectly free hand as to the
course I should pursue, and the means I should adopt
to secure my end&mdash;a concession that had been granted
me with the one stipulation that if I failed or if trouble
arose through my agency our Foreign Office would be
at liberty to disown me.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen how strongly I was tempted to
accept the offer which the Countess Bokara made me,
and which I knew she was in a position to carry out.
But still I hesitated, unwilling to commit myself
definitely to either side prematurely, lest such open
alliance with the one side should make me a mark for
the hostility of the other.</p>

<p>My instincts, sympathies, English associations and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
wishes all prompted me to accept the offer and throw
myself heart and soul into the cause of the Prince;
but I had to walk by the cooler guidance of judgment,
and it had before been in my thoughts rather to seek
an alliance with the Russian party and find among
their ranks the men and means for a counter intrigue
to thwart theirs.</p>

<p>I resolved, therefore, not to pledge myself to this
witching woman, whose strange personality wielded
such fascinating influence.</p>

<p>Few as were the moments that sufficed for these
reflections, they were too many for my companion&#8217;s
patience.</p>

<p>&#8220;How came you here to-night so opportunely?&#8221;
she asked, breaking the silence suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You passed me on the other side of the Cathedral
Square, and I then observed you were being followed.
I followed in my turn, lest you should be in need of
assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are not many men in Sofia who would have
dared to interfere in such a cause. But for you I
should be dead now,&#8221; she shuddered, &#8220;and the Prince
would have had one friend the less&mdash;or may I not say,
two friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince will always have a friend in me,&#8221; I returned
guardedly.</p>

<p>She made a movement of impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want no general phrases.&#8221; Then after a pause
and in a different tone, she added: &#8220;Tell me, what
arguments are the strongest that I can use with you,
my friend? You said just now you were seeking a
career. Have you ambitions? If so, I can promise
you a splendid fulfilment of them. Do you wish
riches? They shall be yours! Have you a heart? I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
will find you as fair a bride as man&#8217;s eyes can rest
upon. Have you judgment? Aye, have you anything&mdash;except
a commitment to the other side&mdash;and
I can prevail with you. Join us, and before three
months are over your head you shall be the Prince&#8217;s
right hand&mdash;and mine.&#8221; The subtle witchery of her
tone in the last two words was indescribable.</p>

<p>But I would not let her prevail, though her words
and manner were well-nigh dazzling enough to carry
me out of myself. The magnetism of her mere presence
was overpowering.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not fair to me, Countess. A man cannot
reason coldly in the presence of such charms as you
exert,&#8221; I answered, stooping to flattery, though telling
the truth.</p>

<p>She shook her head and tapped her foot on the
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say no, bluntly, if you will, but do not try to slip
away with words of cheap and empty flattery. I am
not appealing to you to join for my sake, gladly as I
would welcome you, but for the sake of the Prince,
for the cause of truth, for the honour and safety of
Bulgaria. Stay&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; as I was about to answer, &#8220;I
have seen you act and I have read your character. I
do not make mistakes. I know you are to be trusted.
You have saved my life, at a greater risk than you
may think, for you will be a marked man now; and
I will do more than put my life in your hands&mdash;I will
tell you everything. You will not reveal it&mdash;though,
Heaven knows, betrayal is the religion of most men
here,&#8221; she exclaimed bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather you told me none of your secrets,&#8221;
I said, but she swept my protest aside with a wave of
the hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>&#8220;You wonder why you find me here in this house
alone at night. You must wonder; I will tell you.
It is my mother&#8217;s house&mdash;my own is across the city
near the Palace&mdash;and to-night her own maid came to
me with an urgent message that my mother had been
stricken down suddenly and was dying, and that I
must come at once. It was a lie, of course, though
for the moment it blinded me. I hurried here on foot,
too anxious even to wait for a carriage to be got ready,
and when I arrived the place was empty. While I was
wondering whether I had been betrayed, the men you
saw&mdash;to whom keys of the place had been given&mdash;entered,
and would assuredly have murdered me but
for your arrival. That is how Russia plays her cards
in Bulgaria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know they were Russian agents?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I know that when I am hungry I want to
eat? Wearied, I need sleep? Bah! do you think I
have no instincts, and do not know my enemies?
How do I know their plans and plots?&#8221; She fired
the questions at me with vindictive indignation and a
smile of surprise that I should even ask such a thing.
Then her expression changed to one of deep earnestness,
her tone hard and bitter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you how you shall know it, too. They
have tried every other means but this to separate me
from my Prince. Threats at which I laughed; bribes
to be anything I pleased, which I scorned; hints of
his assassination, which I carried to him; everything&mdash;till
only this was left; and now this,&#8221; and she
touched her wound lightly. &#8220;And even this, thanks
to your valour, Count, has now failed. And their object,
you will ask? They have a plot to drive my
Prince from Bulgaria, because he will not be their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
tool. You know he will not; all Europe knows it, and
knows too that the only chance for Bulgaria&#8217;s real independence
is that he shall remain on the throne here.
And remain he shall, I swear, by the great God they
all profess to worship, in spite of all their crafty intrigue
and bloodthirsty plotting. And yet, mark you,
the worst danger lies not with them, but with the fools
and traitors in Bulgaria itself whom they delude or
suborn. There is not a self-interest to which they do
not appeal, from the ambition of the fool to the corruptness
of the knave. And God knows, both knaves
and fools are plentiful enough here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And their scheme?&#8221; I asked, moved by her intense
earnestness.</p>

<p>She looked at me sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you do wish to hear it?&#8221; she asked, referring
to my former protest. &#8220;You shall. There is a
woman&mdash;a seemingly innocent, soft-natured thing, all
sweetness and grace, but a devil; with the beauty of
an angel and the heart of a vampire&mdash;a devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her fury was instant, overwhelming, absorbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they propose marrying her to your Prince?&#8221;
I asked, making a shot.</p>

<p>She darted at me a swift glance that might have
been winged with hate at the mere suggestion. Then
her eyes changed, and she laughed and said softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the man for us. Calm as a sword and as
sharp as the point. Yes, they dared even that&mdash;but I
was in the way. In another woman&#8217;s hands they
thought he might have been won round. But rather
than see him the husband of that fiend, Christina, I
myself would have plunged a dagger into his heart&mdash;and
they guessed this, I suppose, and changed the
plan. She is the Princess of Orli, as probably you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
know&mdash;for I don&#8217;t suppose you are quite as unknowing
as you seem&mdash;and apparently is all for Bulgaria and
the Bulgarians. Like you, she is a Roumanian, and
like you, if I read you right, she is driven from her
country by the all-powerful Russian predominance&mdash;at
least, that&#8217;s what she says. Isn&#8217;t that why you
left?&#8221; she asked, with quick shrewdness.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Russian predominance there is undoubted,&#8221; I
answered.</p>

<p>She liked the answer and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! you are cautious, and I don&#8217;t blame you.
For the lips that breathe out rashness breathe in danger,
my friend. But now, will you join us? You can
see the career that awaits such a man as yourself here&mdash;at
the right hand of the Prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if the Princess Christina is opposed to Russia,
how does she threaten Bulgaria?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, if?&#8221; and she laughed scornfully. &#8220;There is
another complication. The woman has sold herself to
the Russians. She is betrothed secretly to one of the
worst of them all, a man of infinite vileness and treachery&mdash;the
Duke Sergius. And the plot is that as soon
as this Christina is on the throne, the precious pair are
to be married, and Russia triumphs in despite of anything
Europe may say to the contrary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; and so in truth I did; for in a moment the
kernel of the whole movement was laid bare to me, as
well as the objective of all my work in Bulgaria. I
remained some moments buried in thought, and all
the time my companion&#8217;s eyes were searching my face
for a clue to my thoughts. &#8220;It is very Russian,&#8221; I
said at length, equivocally; and at the words she made
a quick gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not give me a sign,&#8221; she cried, and jumped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
to her feet impulsively. &#8220;But you will join us?&#8221; she
asked. She came close to me as she waited for the
answer, and when I did not answer, she added quickly,
&#8220;Why do you hesitate?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before I could reply, we both heard a noise somewhere
in the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can that be?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;You said there
was no one in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None, that I know;&#8221; and we both stood listening
intently. &#8220;Those rascals may have left the place open
and let in some of the thieves that infest the streets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are no thieves&#8217; footsteps,&#8221; I answered, as
quick steps were heard approaching the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be another attempt on me&mdash;but I have a
brave defender now,&#8221; she said, under her breath.</p>

<p>I had a revolver with me and took it out of my pocket,
glancing to see that the chambers were all loaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better stand back at the end of the room
there,&#8221; and I went towards the door.</p>

<p>At that moment it was opened quickly, and three
men in uniform entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand!&#8221; I called. &#8220;What do you want here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an agent of the Government and hold an order
for the arrest of the Countess Bokara,&#8221; answered the
leader, coming to a sudden halt when he saw me in the
way armed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you cannot execute it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My orders are imperative, sir, and you will resist
me at your peril.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall resist,&#8221; said I shortly. &#8220;Where&#8217;s your
order?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it, that is enough,&#8221; he replied with equal
curtness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Produce it!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;That is not in my instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t believe you have it. Leave the house
before there is any further trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must do my duty. Georgiew,&#8221; he called to one
of the two men, who had kept close to the door in fear,
but now stepped up to his leader&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who has signed your order?&#8221; asked the Countess,
interposing.</p>

<p>&#8220;One whose authority is sufficient for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not for me,&#8221; she cried. I turned, and found
to my surprise that she had come to my side, and was
staring with fixed intensity into the man&#8217;s face. &#8220;Not
for me,&#8221; she repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be prepared to accompany me, madame,
nevertheless, and I trust you will come at once, and
without causing trouble. We are three to one, sir,
and fully armed; resistance will be useless,&#8221; he added
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were thirty to one I would not give way
unless you produced your authority,&#8221; I answered, my
blood beginning to heat under his manner and tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask you for the last time, madame, to come with
me,&#8221; and, with a sign to the others, he made ready to
attack me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, for the last time,&#8221; said my companion, between
her teeth, and before I could guess her intention,
she gave a startling proof of her desperate resource
and deadly recklessness.</p>

<p>With a suddenness that took me entirely by surprise,
she snatched the revolver from me, and levelling it with
quick aim, she fired two shots in rapid succession with
deadly effect, for the two men standing near us fell
dead at our feet, shot through the head. The third,
who had kept near the door, with a coward&#8217;s prudence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
took to his heels incontinently, and left us alone with
the dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God! what have you done?&#8221; I cried, aghast
at her deed. &#8220;These men were soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed into my scared face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose death counts for much in this
country. This is only spy carrion,&#8221; and with the utmost
<i>sang-froid</i> she stooped and rifled the pockets of the
dead leader, turning the body over for the purpose,
and took from his pocket a paper which she held up
for me to read. &#8220;I was sure of it.&#8221;</p>



<p class="center">&#8220;What the bearer does is by my order and authority.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gap">(Signed),</span><span class="gap"> <span class="smcap">M. Kolfort</span>, <i>General</i>.&#8221;</span></p>


<p>&#8220;General Kolfort is the implacable leader of the
Russian party, and that document was my death warrant,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>In a moment I saw my danger, and she read my
thought instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are committed, my friend; now you will
have to join us,&#8221; and she smiled triumphantly in my
face. &#8220;I am glad.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE PRINCESS CHRISTINA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> amazing turn which events had taken through
the terrible act of my companion filled me with consternation
at the possible effects to us both; and after
I had satisfied myself that the two men were dead and
so beyond help, I paced the room in anxious, perturbed
thought.</p>

<p>She was not in the least perturbed, and filled the
minutes by going carefully through the leader&#8217;s papers
in search of anything that would tend to the confusion
of her enemies. A low exclamation of pleasure
told me that, when she found what she sought.</p>

<p>She showed no jot or tittle of remorse at this shedding
of blood. To her the two men were no more
than a couple of wild beasts who had attacked her,
and had been killed in her self-defence. She was as
hard and callous as any public executioner could have
been.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here!&#8221; she cried at length. &#8220;Here are proofs
enough of the villany,&#8221; and she put papers into my
hand which showed plainly enough that the whole
matter had been planned by those high in the Russian
party. One was no less than a clear but brief statement
of instructions. If the first attempt at secret
assassination failed, this endeavour by means of a pretended
arrest by men in uniform dressed to look like
officers was to be made, and the Countess was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
hurried to Tirnova to be dealt with there, should she
reach the fortress alive.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will need these when the attempt is made to
implicate you. Yours is a deadly sin&mdash;to have come
between Kolfort and his vengeance&mdash;and you will
need all your wits to get out of it with your life,
even with these papers, unless you throw yourself
under the protection of the Prince and his party. As
I said, you will have to join us now, Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall still take time to consider,&#8221; I answered
rather shortly. &#8220;You have given me plenty of food for
thought. But now, what of your immediate safety?
You cannot stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor you, either. You let the third man escape,
and by this time he is carrying his news of failure with
feet winged with fear. I have done with this carrion,&#8221;
and she cast a look of repugnance at the dead men,
and turning away, resumed her cloak with great haste.
&#8220;You will not decide now?&#8221; she asked, as she was
ready to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I must have time. But where will you go
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall communicate with you. You will be a
marked man from this hour, and easy to find,&#8221; she said
significantly; &#8220;and if you are in danger sooner than you
expect, do not hesitate to let me know. Our next
meeting will be in the Prince&#8217;s palace, and the sooner
the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where will you go now?&#8221; I repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not fear for me. You will need all your efforts
to save your own skin. Come!&#8221; She left the light
burning, and led the way out of the house by a back
entrance that opened on to a narrow alley, along which
we hurried.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;I will see you safe to your home,&#8221; I said, when she
stopped at the mouth of it and held out her hand.
She smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I am in no danger; but for you, take this
path as far as it goes, turn sharp to the right until you
come to an avenue of trees, and at the bottom of that
you will know where you are. Good-night, Count!
and once more I thank you with all my heart for your
service. But we shall both live to see my thanks in an
alliance that will do great things for the Prince and for
Bulgaria.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave me her hand, and though I pressed her to
let me see her safely across the city, she would not, but
put me on my honour not to follow her, and turning,
sped away, keeping in the shadow, and going at such a
speed that she was soon out of my sight.</p>

<p>Then I followed the way she had told me, and found
myself close to the street in which my hotel was situated.
I walked slowly from that point, my brain in a
whirl of excitement at all that had happened in the
crowded hours of that night.</p>

<p>When I reached my hotel it was only to pace my
room in restless, anxious, brain-racking thought of the
net of complications in which I found myself involved,
and the hundred dangers which appeared to have
sprung up suddenly to menace me. It was in vain that
I threw myself on my bed. I could not sleep. If I
dozed, it was only to start up at the bidding of some
dream danger, threatening me with I know not what
consequences. It was long past the dawn before I
slept, and when the servant called me, I sprang up,
thinking it was my instant arrest that was intended.</p>

<p>But my wits were cooler and more collected for the
rest, and when hour after hour of the anxious day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
passed and nothing happened, I began to think I had
exaggerated the risks of my position.</p>

<p>In the cool of the evening I rode out, and on my
return ventured to find out and pass through the street
of the previous night&#8217;s adventure. Nothing unusual
was astir. No one paid the least heed to me. I might
have been an ordinary tourist without the least interest
in anything but the scenery. So it was at my
hotel. Nothing happened that evening nor on any of
the three remaining days of the week, and I occupied
myself with the business of preparing the large house
which I had taken for my residence.</p>

<p>Yet, even the lack of any consequences to me had a
grim significance. It seemed a fearsome thing, indeed,
that murder could be attempted openly, and two of
the would-be assassins shot dead in the effort, and yet
the life of the city flow on without the least interruption,
and, as it appeared, with never a person to ask a
question about them or show the faintest interest in the
event. Truly, as my strange companion in the adventure
had said, death counted for little in the grim game
of intrigue that was being played in the country.</p>

<p>I had provided myself with a few letters of introduction,
and, knowing the average poverty of the people
and the high esteem set on riches, I had dropped a
number of judicious hints that I was a man of considerable
wealth. I had taken the largest house I could
find in the city, and by these means had opened a way
into a certain section of society. It had been my
original intention to use such opportunities as would
thus be afforded to carry out my original intention.
But the adventure with the Countess Bokara would
render this less necessary should I resolve to accept
the offer of close service with the Prince which she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
made me; and the few guarded inquiries I was able to
make as to her influence confirmed completely my
previous belief in her power to fulfil all she had
promised.</p>

<p>Several days passed, and I was in this condition of
comparative uncertainty when, toward the close of the
week following my adventure, an incident occurred
which gave me startling proof that, for all the apparent
quietude, I myself was, as she had declared, a marked
man.</p>

<p>I was sitting alone in a <i>caf&eacute;</i> one evening, my friends
having left me, when my attention was attracted to the
movements of three men, two being in uniform, at a
table in a far corner of the place. They were busily
occupied over some papers, and a constant succession
of men kept coming to them, as it seemed to me, for
some kind of instructions. As business was constantly
transacted in this way at the <i>caf&eacute;s</i>, I had at first no
more than a feeling of idle curiosity; but when the
thing had continued for an hour or more, my interest
deepened, and I watched them closely, although, as I
thought, unobserved by them.</p>

<p>At length a message was given them which appeared
to cause great surprise, and they paid their score and
hurried out of the place.</p>

<p>I followed them, still impelled mainly by curiosity;
and as they were engrossed in conversation, talking
and gesticulating, I had no difficulty in keeping them
in sight as they passed through several streets, and at
length entered a large house which filled one side of a
small quadrangle, close on the street.</p>

<p>I stood awhile at the corner, scanning the house
curiously, and made a mental note to ascertain to
whom it belonged, and was in the act of turning away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
to retrace my steps to the hotel, when a man came out
of the house, glanced about him as though in some
doubt, and then looked closely at me. He walked to
the corner of the street opposite, still looking at me,
and after a minute of doubt, crossed to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am to give you this, sir,&#8221; he said, speaking with
the manner of a confidential servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;To me? I think not. What name?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no name given to me, but I was to say it was
&#8216;In the Name of a Woman!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;In the Name of a Woman?&#8217;&#8221; I repeated. It
could not be for me. I knew no such pass-word, and I
connected it instantly with what I had seen at the
<i>caf&eacute;</i>. I was about to send the man away, when it
occurred to me that it might be a message from the
Countess Bokara, and that, from a love of mystery, she
had chosen this exceedingly ambiguous method of communication.
I took the letter which the man held out,
therefore, and read a message written in a woman&#8217;s
handwriting:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Follow the Bearer,<br />
<span class="gap">In the Name of a Woman.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>I was disposed to smile, but checked myself on seeing
the servant&#8217;s eyes fixed upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am to follow you,&#8221; I said gravely.</p>

<p>Without a word he led the way back to the house,
through the deep gloomy archway, in which I noticed
a number of servants and others lounging and waiting,
and up three or four steps into the house. Turning to
make sure that I was behind him, the man crossed a
hall, in which were more men, some in uniform, through
a curtained archway at the end, and up a broad stairway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
on to a wide landing-place until he paused before
a large dark oak door. He opened this quietly and
stood aside for me to enter.</p>

<p>As I did so, some words came to my ears that were
certainly not intended for a stranger to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curse the business. I am sick of the place. The
sooner this thing&#8217;s over and Christina is on the throne
and married to Sergius, the sooner we shall be back in
Moscow and out of this beastly hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice was loud and strident, and the language
Russian; and the speaker, a young red-haired man, in
an officer&#8217;s uniform, laughed noisily. I was in the room
before the sentence ended, but I came to an abrupt
halt in my surprise, and perceiving at once the mistake
that had been made, I half turned to leave the room
again. But the man who had brought me had already
closed the door.</p>

<p>My surprise was not one whit greater than that of
the three men in the room, however, who were standing
together by a table with their backs to the door, and
not having heard it open, did not know I was there
till the officer who had spoken turned round.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! who the devil&#8217;s this?&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;What do you want, sir?&#8221; and I saw his hand go to
his sword hilt.</p>

<p>His companions turned quickly on hearing him, and
stared at me with evident amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet, Marx,&#8221; said one of them in Russian, a
much older man, and apparently in command. Then
in Bulgarian to me, &#8220;May I ask your business, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On my word, I know no more than yourself,&#8221; I
answered, keeping my eye on the red-haired man
whose threatening looks I did not at all like. &#8220;I am
here &#8216;In the Name of a Woman,&#8217; I presume. A messenger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
accosted me a few minutes since in the street
close by and gave me a written message to follow him.
He brought me here&mdash;and that&#8217;s all I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A cool devil, on my word,&#8221; exclaimed the red-headed
man, and whispered something to the third
which I could not catch.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has seemingly been some mistake,&#8221; said the
elder man suavely. &#8220;You have not been long in the
room, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not, the door has but barely closed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too much of a gentleman, of course, to
intrude yourself upon us unannounced and listen to
our private conversation.&#8221; There was an ominous
suggestion of threat in the words, and behind them I
could detect not a little anxiety and embarrassment.</p>

<p>One of the other officers gave a little sneering
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish to know whether I have overheard anything?
I speak Russian, and as I entered I could not
help hearing what was being said.&#8221;</p>

<p>A look of concern showed on all three faces as I
spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have the goodness to repeat what you
overheard,&#8221; said the elder man, his voice hardening
and deepening.</p>

<p>I repeated in Russian almost word for word what
had been said, and the man whose unguarded words I
had overheard turned very white.</p>

<p>An embarrassing silence followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what meaning do you attach to the words,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not see that they concern me, or that I am
called upon to give any explanation,&#8221; I answered
coolly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>&#8220;By God! you shall answer,&#8221; broke in impetuously
and passionately the red-haired man, as he made a
couple of strides toward me.</p>

<p>His superior frowned upon him and muttered a word
of caution.</p>

<p>I began to feel glad that I had brought my sword-stick
with me.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment; excuse me,&#8221; said the elder man,
whose great uneasiness was now very manifest, and
the three held a hurried consultation, in which I could
see the red-haired man urging some plan from which
the elder strongly dissented. Then the latter turned
again to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must press you to answer my question, sir,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The words could have only one possible meaning,&#8221;
I replied, seeing no use in equivocation. &#8220;The hope
was expressed that Christina, presumably the Princess
of Orli, would soon be on the throne and married to
the Duke Sergius, in order that the speaker might
be free to return to Moscow.&#8221; I spoke very deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you so. The fellow may be a spy and can&#8217;t
go free after that,&#8221; exclaimed the fiery officer. &#8220;Have
up the men at once and let him be secured until we
find out all about him,&#8221; and he went to the bell-pull to
summon the servants or more probably soldiers.</p>

<p>My next act surprised him and stayed his hand,
however. I had observed a couple of heavy bolts on
the door, and thinking that I had better have three
men to deal with than thirty, I shot them into their
sockets, and setting my back to the door, said shortly:</p>

<p>&#8220;There should be nothing in this which we cannot
settle amongst ourselves, gentlemen, and with your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
permission I prefer to have no one else here until it is
settled.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was too much for the two younger men. They
drew their swords at once and came toward me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will stand aside from that door at once, or
take the consequences,&#8221; said the red-haired man.</p>

<p>My answer was to whip my sword from the stick
and put myself on the defensive. The door stood in
an angle of the room, excellently placed for my purpose,
as my two opponents would be much hampered
in attacking me together, and I was not afraid of what
either could do single-handed.</p>

<p>Their anger at my resistance made them deaf to the
protests and expostulations of their superior. The
red man was the first to cross swords, and he was so
indifferent a swordsman that I could have disabled
him had not the second perceived his inferiority and
made at me in his turn.</p>

<p>A very pretty fight followed, but infinitely perilous
to me. Even if I were successful I could not see how
possibly to escape from the house, which as I knew
was swarming with men. But I went to work with a
will, and soon had cause to thank the advantage I
gained owing to the position of the door.</p>

<p>The object of the less furious of the two was rather to
disarm than to wound, and I noticed that he neglected
more than one opportunity of wounding me. The
other was a hot-headed fool, however, and was obviously
dead bent on killing me; but a couple of minutes later
I had an excellent chance of settling matters with him.
He was fighting in a furious, haphazard, reckless fashion,
when the second man stumbled from some cause
and was out of the fray for several passes. I made
the most of the respite, and pressing the fight to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
utmost, I ran my assailant through the sword-arm, inflicting
a wound which caused him to drop his sword.
I kicked it behind me, and was thus free to devote my
whole attention to my other assailant.</p>

<p>I was cleverer with the weapon than he, as I perceived
to my intense satisfaction, and was considering
where I would wound him and end the fight, when my
luck turned. I trod by mischance on the hilt of the
sword at my feet, stumbled, and, unable to save myself,
fell staggering at full length on the floor.</p>

<p>It was all over, and I gave myself up for lost, when a
most unexpected and infinitely welcome interruption
came.</p>

<p>A door at the other end of the room, which was hidden
by the curtains and tapestries that covered the
walls, opened, and I heard a woman&#8217;s soft clear voice,
in which vibrated a note of indignation and anger,
exclaim:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, what is this brawling?&#8221;</p>

<p>The others turned at the sound of the voice, and I
scrambled to my feet in an instant, gripped my weapon
again, and was once more ready against attack; though
I stared with all my eyes at the lovely face of the
queenly woman who had entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put up your swords, gentlemen, instantly!&#8221; she
said; and in obedience the man who still had his
weapon sheathed it and fell back abashed behind his
superior officer.</p>

<p>Intuitively I recognised the Princess Christina.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>&#8220;THE WEB IS WIDE, THE MESHES HARD TO BREAK&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">As</span> beautiful as an angel, and with the heart of a
vampire.&#8221;</p>

<p>This bitter description rushed to my thoughts as I
gazed at the Princess Christina. Surely never had
treachery, cruelty, and ambition a fairer guise than
hers, if treacherous and cruel she could be.</p>

<p>But the thought started another suspicion. Had this
scene all been planned by her to catch me in the toils?
It was a dramatic enough entrance for me into her
circle, and certainly clever. It had been made to appear
as if I had forced my way into the house, had
overheard a compromising secret, had had my very life
placed in danger, and then at the critical moment it
was to her coming I owed my safety. If this were so,
I could understand why the less hot-headed of my two
assailants had first rushed to the assistance of his comrade,
but had then refrained from pressing the advantage
of the odds against me in the fight, and had not
attempted even to wound me.</p>

<p>Could that lovely, ingenuous-looking woman have
laid such a scheme, and then have carried it out with
such shrewd stage-management, putting that little ring
of anger into her voice at all the clatter of the fight?</p>

<p>If so the danger that had seemed to threaten me
had never existed, and I might as well do as she bade,
and put up the sword which had never been needed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
earnest. With a smile at the notion I sheathed it, and
waited for the next development of the comedy.</p>

<p>Yet the anger in her eyes seemed sincere enough, and
if she was only acting she understood her business well;
for the indignation on her face and the liquid notes
of her perfect voice moved me to regret even my share
in the fracas, though it had been none of my seeking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Zankoff, have you such poor command of
your subordinates that they must seek to shed blood
almost in my very presence?&#8221; At the rebuke the
eldest of the three men winced and bit his lip, but
made no reply except a bow. &#8220;You know my will,
sir!&#8221; she continued, with the mien of an empress;
&#8220;and any repetition of this forgetfulness will find me
deeply angered even against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame, I am already punished,&#8221; replied the major,
with the bow of a courtier and the shrewdness of
a diplomat.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for you, gentlemen,&#8221; she said, turning to the
other two, &#8220;I shall use my influence to see that you
are relieved from duties which you must surely find
irksome, since you seek relaxation in this cut and
thrust work. Be good enough to leave me.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a somewhat embarrassing request, for I was
by the door, and still held my foot on the fallen sword.
I was not disposed to have the door open lest others
should be brought in, and they were not willing that I
should have a chance of escape, carrying their secret
with me. The three exchanged looks, and then the
major came to the rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a matter that needs explanation to you,
madame&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began, when she cut him short.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will hear nothing, Major Zankoff, until these
gentlemen have left me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>Another embarrassing pause followed, in which she
let her eyes glance toward me and rest a moment on
my face, with an effect I cannot describe. In an instant
it seemed as if all my doubts of her sincerity
dropped from me like a cloak. I felt absolutely assured,
not only of her purity and truth, but of my own
complete safety in trusting her, and with an impulse
that was as irresistible as it was instantaneous, I cut
the knot of the difficulty.</p>

<p>I picked up the fallen sword, left my place by the
door, and handed it back to the owner.</p>

<p>He flashed a curse at me out of his eyes that I should
have been the cause and witness of his humiliation,
and muttered in a tone too low to reach other ears
than mine, as he bent his head in sheathing the
weapon:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will find you out, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count Benderoff, H&ocirc;tel de l&#8217;Europe,&#8221; I whispered,
meeting his look with one as stern as his own, and
then stood aside for him and his companion to pass
out of the room.</p>

<p>The Princess waited in silence until the door had
closed behind them, and then addressed me:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have you come to bring your quarrels here,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can best explain&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Major
Zankoff.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have asked this gentleman for his explanation,
Major,&#8221; she broke in, and I liked her calm assertion
of authority.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brought no quarrel here, Madame,&#8221; and I
explained very briefly the facts up to the moment of
her entrance.</p>

<p>She bent her dark eyes on me during the recital, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
gradually the colour of her cheeks deepened, until at
the close, with a flush of indignation and anger, she
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been shamefully treated, sir&mdash;shamefully
and outrageously. Because by chance some hot-headed
idler cannot keep his tongue still, but must
blab of matters he does not understand, shall murder
be attempted? Major Zankoff, what had this gentleman
done that you should sanction this atrocious act?
We owe you an ample apology, sir; and I, the Princess
Christina of Orli&#8221;&mdash;drawing herself to her full
height&mdash;&#8220;tender it to you. I do not ask your name.
I ask nothing, but only tell you I am profoundly sorry
and deeply grieved that this should have occurred.
Major Zankoff, it is my express wish that you will see
this gentleman safely out of the house, and conduct
him to any part of the city he desires. His safety will
be your personal charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this she swept across the room and herself
held open the door for me to leave.</p>

<p>Her beauty and grace, and, much more, the instinctive
justice of her act and implied trust in my
honour, conquered me. I did not wish to leave her,
and lingered gazing at her in admiration. This was
the Countess Bokara&#8217;s vampire. If this was how she
gained her victims, I, at any rate, was ready to be one
of them. As we stood thus, she holding the door and
I unwilling to go, our eyes met, and I was filled with
one consuming, burning impulse to serve her.</p>

<p>Then came an interruption, which I for one welcomed
profoundly.</p>

<p>An old man, in the uniform of a high Russian officer,
entered through the door which she had used, and
in a high-pitched voice said sharply:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;This is a somewhat unusual scene. What does it
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was watching the Princess closely, and saw an expression
of some disconcertment and alarm rush into
her eyes, to be as quickly forced down and followed
by what I half dared to hope was a look of solicitude
on my account. The eyes seemed to beg me to leave
while the way was still open.</p>

<p>But I would not have gone for a fortune. I was
ten thousand times more eager to stay.</p>

<p>Major Zankoff gave an expressive shrug of the shoulders
as he said in reply to the question: &#8220;There has
been a little misunderstanding, General.&#8221;</p>

<p>The small, alert, piercing eyes seemed to take in the
situation at one sweeping glance that dwelt lastly on
my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Princess, can I have a word with you? Major
Zankoff, close the door and guard it. We want no
one in&mdash;or out,&#8221; he let the last two words drop from
his lips as though they were an after-thought and not
intended to be spoken aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am telling this gentleman that he is at liberty to
leave here, General,&#8221; she answered, lifting her head
with what I read as an intentional assertion of authority,
not made, however, without an effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good of you, very good indeed,&#8221; he replied
drily. &#8220;But as the gentleman does not seem disposed
to go, suppose we close the door. There is a draught
for one thing, and pretty situations should never be
strained. Besides, I wish to have a word with him
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>My wits had been somewhat mazed by the unexpected
character of the meeting with the Princess and
the whirl of strange and disturbing thoughts which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
had started, but these last words of the old soldier
recalled me to myself quickly enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;With me?&#8221; I said in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, with you,&#8221; he answered sharply.</p>

<p>The suggestion of solicitude for me still lingered on
the Princess&#8217;s face as she left the door and went to the
old man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have passed my word for his safety, General,&#8221;
and she looked meaningly at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I look so fierce and terrible an object, madame,
that the gentleman will be afraid to trust himself alone
with me, think you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have passed my word for his safety,&#8221; she repeated,
and turning to me, she added, &#8220;You may depend
upon that, sir,&#8221; and as she left the room she gave me a
look from her glorious eyes which seemed to say much
more than even her words.</p>

<p>The old soldier smiled sardonically, and bowed low
to her as she passed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph! And now, sir, will you come with me; or
are you, as madame was disposed to think, afraid to
trust yourself with me? Zankoff, I do not wish to be
disturbed,&#8221; he said abruptly to the Major.</p>

<p>He led me to a room beyond and motioned
me to a chair, near the table at which he seated himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, I presume, where you are, who I am,
and who that is we have just left!&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know all, but I can make a shrewd guess.
She is the Princess Christina; you, I presume, General
Kolfort, and this house, either yours or hers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you say, a very shrewd guess&mdash;even for one
known to have such quick wits as the Count Benderoff,
of Radova.&#8221; He intended to surprise me, as indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
he did, by the mention of my name; but I showed no
sign of this, although he looked for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you force your way in here&mdash;unless, indeed,
you had an object which I shall only be too glad
to welcome?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will make another guess,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I came
through your own contriving, General;&#8221; and this time
it was he, not I, who had to conceal surprise&mdash;for my
guess was right.</p>

<p>He looked at me and nodded his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my business to know all newcomers to Sofia,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;And you are too notable and have started
too much comment for me not to know of you. My
agents serve me well, and I thought it was full time
for you to declare yourself. There are only two
courses open to a man making a career in this country,
as you have said you intend to do. Only two sides,
one of which a man must take. You must be either
for or against the interests of Russia&mdash;which is it to
be?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was plain talking in all truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been in the country too short a time to
have weighed the considerations which must determine
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good; evasive but politic, though not, of course,
convincing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet true,&#8221; said I shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. We&#8217;ll take it at that;&#8221; and he looked
at me as if he were pondering carefully the arguments
he should use to convince and win me. &#8220;Yet you&#8217;ve
not been quite inactive, have you, although here so
short a time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What should I mean?&#8221; he asked, throwing up his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
hands with an indifference that was belied by the sharp
glint of his eyes.</p>

<p>Did he know of that night adventure, after all? If
so, I had indeed walked into the spider&#8217;s web.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I have not been inactive, certainly not,&#8221; I
answered carelessly. &#8220;I have had to find a house
suitable for my position and my means. I am a man
of some wealth, and the work has taken time and care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt. But I did not mean that kind of activity,
Count. My sources of information are many&mdash;and
secret. Few things are done in Sofia without my
knowing them, as well as those who do them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Through your spies, you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved the term aside and passed over the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have had an accident lately, rather an awkward
affair, which resulted in the death of a couple of our
agents; but a third escaped and tells a strange story.
Even your short acquaintance with Bulgarian affairs
will tell you that the consequences may be serious for
those concerned in their death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand that. But with what object do
you make me the recipient of such a confidence?&#8221; I
asked coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have made some shrewd guesses during
our talk; I will leave you to make another in that
matter. It may be only a parable; or, on the contrary,
a matter of life or death for those concerned.
In any case, the person concerned is known to me.&#8221;
The threat was conveyed with unmistakable significance.
I understood him well enough, and he knew
that I did; but I answered lightly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that this affects me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope with all my heart that it never will,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
said quickly, &#8220;for nothing would please me better
than to have you enrolled on our side!&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused to let this, his first argument&mdash;an appeal
to my fears&mdash;have due weight, and watched me keenly
to note results. Apparently he was not too well
satisfied with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have probably asked yourself why I am anxious,
as I confess I am, that you should be with us,
and yet if you reflect you will readily understand the
reason. I have told you that there are but two courses
open to a man who mixes in politics here. He must
take a side. There is no possible alternative&mdash;no possible
alternative. Well, I know much about you&mdash;more
than you think, and I do not wish that a man
who has shown such courage as you, on other occasions
than to-day,&#8221; he put in meaningly, &#8220;who has those
parts of head and heart that carry a man far in troubled
times like these; a man wealthy, daring, shrewd,
honorable, ambitious, resourceful, and bound to wield
influence, should enter the lists against me. Such a
man must make a leader, and these Bulgars readily
follow when the right man leads. It is all against our
cause that such qualities should be devoted to the
service of a craven Prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak with great frankness.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled and raised his eyebrows, giving a slight
toss of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can be frank with perfect safety. You are in my
power, Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the word of Princess Christina&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not mean in this house, I mean in this country,&#8221;
he interposed. &#8220;If you do not know the reach
of my hands, it is time you learnt it. No man crosses
this frontier without my knowledge, and no one recrosses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
it against my will. Do not mistake me; I
don&#8217;t speak at random, nor am I uttering a mere empty
boast. I am stating a plain fact. And the power
which I wield you can share, if you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was skilfully turned and cleverly put, and for the
moment I was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;The web is wide, the meshes hard to break, Count;
and I brought you here that you might see how wide
and how hard. You were right just now in that
shrewd guess of yours&mdash;I did bring you here. First,
for that little dramatic test of your courage; next,
that you should see for yourself the glorious woman in
whose cause we fight; and lastly, that you should
understand the obstacles that lie in the path of those
who would oppose us. You say you seek a career.
Well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He paused here and looked most keenly
at me as he added, &#8220;Englishmen have done the
same before&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not repress a start of surprise at the thrust,
and he stopped to enjoy it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Englishmen&mdash;and Roumanians. But it is
very rare for a Roumanian to combine the qualities
which distinguish you, Count Benderoff. You perhaps
know the English. If I mistake not, your father was
an Englishman, and you may have met a certain Hon.
Gerald Winthrop. I have such a man in my mind
when I speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat gnawing my lip, my brows knitted in thought,
and had no reply, while he looked at me with a smile
at my evident consternation.</p>

<p>Then he gave a sudden and unexpected turn to the
matter.</p>

<p>Pushing his chair back, he rose, and said in a frank
and apparently friendly tone:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>&#8220;I have taken you by surprise. Of course I know
that, and do not wish to push the advantage unfairly.
Don&#8217;t decide now. I want your decision to be deliberate
and the result of judgment, and not mere embarrassment.
I will make you a fair offer. The frontier
is free for you for three days&mdash;nay, for a week.
Join us within that time, or let my agents report to me
that you have crossed it. I want your services because
I value them, but I do not intend my enemies to have
them. If you really wish to make a career, I can help
you as no one else can. I want no oaths; they don&#8217;t
bind me, and in this place bind no one beyond the
limits of self-interest. If you join us, you would have
to be faithful, or your life would be a mere candle-flame
to be snuffed out at will. That is a better guarantee
than any mere oaths. If you decide to throw in
your lot with us, I shall be glad to see you at any time.
If not, I hope we shall not meet again.&#8221; And he held
out his hand.</p>

<p>I took it, not over cordially, and left him, dismayed,
perplexed and anxious, but with an appreciation of his
power keen enough to have satisfied even him.</p>

<small>&#8220;SPERNOW&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A night&#8217;s</span> reflection brought but slight relief to my
anxiety and doubt. How that wily Russian general
had succeeded so easily and promptly in discovering
all about me, I was at a loss to guess; nor was it of
much profit to inquire. He had the facts, and the
question was how he would use them; and the first
gleam of an answer came from a very small thing.</p>

<p>He had offered me first three days in which to leave
the country, and then had extended the time to a
week. Why? I came to the conclusion at length
that he had probably a double reason, for he was not
the man to do anything without a clear reason. He
was all against my joining the party of the Prince,
and was probably resolved to go to extreme lengths
to prevent me. But he knew also, though he had been
crafty enough not to admit it openly, that I was an
Englishman; and that fact might well embarrass him
in dealing with me.</p>

<p>Any ill-treatment of a British subject at such a
juncture might bring about just such grave complications
with our Foreign Office as might imperil the
whole Russian under-current policy. That was, therefore,
unquestionably one of my strong cards to play,
and I resolved to use it promptly.</p>

<p>I judged that in all probability my correspondence
would be tampered with, and would, if necessary, pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
under his own eyes; so I wrote a letter to a friend in
England, stating the fact plainly that I had had an
interview with General Kolfort, the Russian leader,
in which the fact that I was a British subject had been
discussed between us, and added a few words of assumed
annoyance that this should have happened, as
it might interfere with my plans in making a career
in Bulgaria. I put in some other general matter such
as might be written in a friendly letter, and finished
with a request that my correspondent would send me
two or three articles I had left in his care. This was
all fable, of course; but I wrote it to make it more
difficult for the General to suppress the letter. Then
I added a postscript, with the usual sting in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you get a chance, you might drop a side hint to
Edwardes, of the Foreign Office, that I am here, and
known to be English.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sealed the letter with careful clumsiness, so that
the envelope could easily be opened without the seal
being broken, marked it &#8220;Urgent. Strictly private,&#8221;
and then gave it to a waiter to post. If I was under
the surveillance he had suggested, I felt convinced
that nothing more was necessary to ensure its getting
immediately into the General&#8217;s hands. It would at
least give him food for thought.</p>

<p>Then as to his second object. Why had he given
me any time at all? A Russian party, strong and
unscrupulous enough to plan the assassination of the
reigning Prince himself&mdash;as they had done&mdash;would
have thought nothing of keeping me, a mere Roumanian
Count (as I told them I was when they had me
on the previous evening), rushing me off incontinently
to the frontier, and bidding me be off about my business
under fear of a stray bullet should I attempt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
return. But he had given me a week to deliberate,
and I drew the inference that he was really anxious to
have an Englishman on his side, and that he meant to
use the week to bring strong inducements to bear
upon me.</p>

<p>And through all these reflections one dazzling remembrance
flashed, as the sun will flash through thin
foliage after a summer shower&mdash;the great steady glare
caught and reflected from a myriad drops on the wet,
dancing leaves. It was the memory of the glorious
beauty of the Princess, with that look of solicitude
for me and of fear of the General which I had seemed
to catch.</p>

<p>I had no more desire to fly the country than I had
had to leave her witching presence, and a thousand
thoughts rushed through my mind, bewildering, stirring,
fascinating me, and all urging me to stay until I
had at least probed the meaning of her look, and determined
whether I could in any way serve her. If she
really stood in need of a friend, how gladly&mdash;&mdash; And
at that point I broke the thought with a laugh at my
own silly conceit. She had a hundred, aye, a thousand
men at her command. And I was a fool.</p>

<p>But I would not leave the country if I could help it,
and I ordered a horse and rode out, first to see how
nearly my house was ready, and then away for a gallop
in the country.</p>

<p>On my return I learned that two officers had called
and asked for me; had left word that, as their business
was urgent, they would return early in the afternoon.
I did not know the names&mdash;Captain Dimitrieff
and Lieutenant Grassaw&mdash;and I could not think what
they wanted with me, but I resolved to wait in for
them; and while I was waiting, a servant brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
me a card from another stranger&mdash;Lieutenant Spernow.</p>

<p>The moment he entered I liked his pleasant, cheery
looks, and his frank, unrestrained, self-possessed manner
impressed me most favourably. With a smile he
offered me his hand, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come in a quite unusual way, Count Benderoff.
I am sent, in fact, to make your acquaintance.
I am assured we shall speedily be friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am certainly at your service,&#8221; I answered, unable
to resist a smile at his singular introduction.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has an odd sound after all, hasn&#8217;t it; and yet,
do you know, I&#8217;ve been thinking how I should put it
and rehearsing, all the way. It does sound devilish
odd from a stranger, but I do hope&mdash;for reasons that
weigh infinitely with me, I can assure you&mdash;that so odd
an introduction will really lead to friendship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you were sent to me?&#8221; I asked, cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I assure you I am frankness itself. They
never trust me with important secrets; I blurt them
out;&#8221; and he laughed, as though that were rather a
good trait. &#8220;Old Kolfort sent me&mdash;Old Kolfort for
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw General Kolfort last evening,&#8221; I replied,
drily. &#8220;But sit down and have a cigar, and then tell
me why he is so interested in providing me with
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good straight question, but I&#8217;ll be hanged
if I can answer it. He&#8217;s such a sly old fox, with fifty
secret reasons for every plain one. Thanks, I&#8217;ll have
a cigar. Well, he sent for me this morning&mdash;you
know, I am on the Russian tack in all this business,
and that for a reason which I&#8217;m pretty sure to let out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
before I&#8217;ve been many minutes with you; in fact,
bound to, come to think of it&mdash;and&mdash;let&#8217;s see, where
was I? Oh, yes; he sent for me, and said, &#8216;Lieutenant,
I have a pleasant duty for you&mdash;and an important
one. I wish you to go to Count Benderoff and make
a friend of him&mdash;he told me your hotel&mdash;and do what
you can to make his stay in Sofia pleasant, as it may
be only a very short one. You&#8217;re the best man I know
to let him see what&#8217;s worth seeing in the city, and to
let him know what&#8217;s worth knowing.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It promises to be a very kind act on his part.&#8221; I
spoke sincerely, and my visitor smiled at the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall be, if you&#8217;ll let me, Count, I assure you.
But that old fox always has a bitter wrapped up somewhere
in the sweet; and as I was leaving, after having
talked you over, of course, he pretended to remember
something, and said, &#8216;Oh, by the way, take this letter
to the Count with an apology from me. By an unfortunate
mistake it has got opened by some clumsy
idiot, and was brought to me to know what should be
done. Tell the Count I&#8217;m very sorry, but perhaps he
may not care to send it for a week or so, after all.&#8217;
&#8216;What is it?&#8217; said I. &#8216;Of no consequence; but the
little act will be an introduction for you.&#8217; Then I saw
it was one of those infernal things that are always being
done in this country&mdash;an intercepted letter, and I
felt inclined to fling it in his face, only I daren&#8217;t. I let
him have a word or two about choosing me for such
work, but I brought it, and I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m
a regular cad to lend myself to such a thing. But I&#8217;ll
tell you why I decided to bring it in a minute; and I
hope I needn&#8217;t assure you I don&#8217;t know a word of
what&#8217;s inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>I accepted his word without hesitation, and believed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
in his expressions of disgust at the mission. I
took the letter readily enough, and was indeed glad
that my little ruse had succeeded so completely. Then
I gave it a finishing touch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he&#8217;ll expect you to report what I said.
Well, here&#8217;s the answer.&#8221; I struck a match and set
fire to the letter, holding it until it was consumed. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not of the least consequence, I assure you, for I took the
precaution to send off a duplicate in proper disguise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil you did. I&#8217;m infernally glad to hear it.
I love to hear of old Crafty being licked at his own
game.&#8221; Then he started and rapped the table as he
laughed and asked: &#8220;Was that a decoy? Oh, that&#8217;s
lovely. I won&#8217;t tell him. I hate the old tyrant, and
he knows it; but he knows, too, that I&#8217;m horribly
afraid of him. And that&#8217;s what he likes. Gad, that&#8217;s
good!&#8221; and he lay back in his chair and laughed aloud
at the thought of the General being outwitted. &#8220;And
he was so damned serious, too, that I know he thought
he&#8217;d done a mighty smart thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was obviously sincere, and it was impossible not
to see that he thoroughly enjoyed what he deemed a
good joke. When he had had his laugh out, he gave a
little sigh of relief as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s over, and I hope you&#8217;ll acquit me of
any personal part in the matter or humbug.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear sir, I acquit you of everything except of
having done an unpleasant thing pleasantly,&#8221; I answered,
cordially.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. And now, is your stay going to be very
short in Sofia? I must tell you before you answer
that that&#8217;s a thing old Crafty told me to find out. I
suppose he has some underground reason or other?
He&#8217;s a beggar for that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>&#8220;Frankly, I don&#8217;t know. I hope not, but I don&#8217;t
yet know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I was surprised when he mentioned it, because
we&#8217;d heard that you&#8217;d taken a big house, and
were going to make a bit of a splash, you know. And,
by Jove, it would be a blessing, for most of the houses
here are just deadly dull.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>We</i> heard,&#8217; you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How quick you are!&#8221; he answered with a smile,
and he had a slightly heightened colour as he went on.
&#8220;Yes, we&mdash;we two; not old Kolfort, you know. But&mdash;well,
we&#8217;ve had a chat about you more than once;
and last night, after you&#8217;d been at the General&#8217;s house,
we had a regular consultation about you&mdash;and, to tell
you the truth, that&#8217;s another reason why I&#8217;ve come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course you don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t altogether. I
think; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He hesitated, and pulled at his cigar
for some moments in a little embarrassment. &#8220;You
see, it&#8217;s a bit difficult to make you understand without
telling what a man doesn&#8217;t care to talk about. I suppose
something happened at the General&#8217;s that affected
you closely, and made you&mdash;hang it all! Wait a
minute, and let me try and think how I was to put it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled again at this, and watched him as he fidgeted
with his cigar somewhat nervously and uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw the Princess there, didn&#8217;t you? I don&#8217;t
know, but I heard something or other; and, anyway,
she must have been speaking to&mdash;to someone who
spoke to me. Doesn&#8217;t that sound rather ridiculous?&#8221;</p>

<p>But I scarcely heard his question. The reference
to the Princess Christina had set my thoughts whirling
at the bare idea that he was in some remote way a
messenger from her, and that she was sufficiently interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
in me to make these indirect inquiries as to
my movements and intentions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw the Princess last night,&#8221; I said, breaking
the pause. &#8220;Do you come from her?&#8221; I was astonished
at the steadiness of the tone in which I spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes; but yet not exactly&mdash;oh, hang it all,
I&#8217;d better out with it. I shall only make a mess of
things;&#8221; and he laughed gaily, and flushed. &#8220;I came
to you mainly because I was asked to do so by Mademoiselle
Broumoff, who is one of her closest companions;
and Mademoiselle Broumoff and I are, in
fact, betrothed. Now you&#8217;ve got it, Count; and that&#8217;s
why I fiddled about just now, and didn&#8217;t know quite
what to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am much mistaken if Mademoiselle Broumoff,
whose acquaintance I shall hope to make, is not an
exceedingly fortunate girl, lieutenant; and I speak
without the least affectation when I say that your
news interests me deeply.&#8221;</p>

<p>It did, in all truth. To have as a friend someone
who was in the close confidence of the Princess herself,
was a stroke of good fortune which I could indeed appreciate;
and I resolved to bind this handsome young
officer to me by all possible bonds.</p>

<p>&#8220;The one commission is an antidote to the other,
at any rate, I hope,&#8221; said Spernow; &#8220;and if it&#8217;s any
gratification to you to know it, you can rest assured
that the Princess takes a lively interest in you, and for
some reason or other feels herself under some sort of
obligation to you. Frankly, I don&#8217;t know what it is;
but I do know there are plenty of our fellows who&#8217;d
like to stand in your shoes in such a thing. You can&#8217;t
think how we worship that woman!&#8221; he cried, with a
flash of sudden enthusiasm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>&#8220;I can think of no cause for such a feeling of obligation,&#8221;
said I, speaking indifferently to hide the tingling
glow of delight at his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course. By Jove, I was nearly forgetting,&#8221;
he exclaimed, with a jerk, as he plunged his hand into
his pocket and brought out a packet of papers. &#8220;Are
you engaged for to-morrow night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? No indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll be able to come all right. I&#8217;ve got
you a card for the ball at the Assembly. It&#8217;s a big
do; and most of the folks worth knowing will be there,
if you want to know them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this from the General?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not exactly, though he&#8217;ll be glad enough
for you to go. Mademoiselle Broumoff put me up
to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I may have the pleasure of seeing her there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, she&#8217;s going, rather; and the Princess
too. You&#8217;ll come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be very pleased. It is just the chance I
shall welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Was this another little personal attention from the
Princess, or merely a development of the policy of winning
me to the Russian side? I was turning this over,
and thinking how far I could get the answer from Spernow,
when a servant came to say that the two officers
who had called earlier in the day had returned.</p>

<p>I told the man to show them in, and explained
matters to Spernow. He knew them, he said, but not
their errand.</p>

<p>This was soon explained, and caused me no little
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;We come from Lieutenant Ristich,&#8221; said Captain
Dimitrieff, speaking very formally and stiffly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>&#8220;And who is Lieutenant Ristich?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;I do
not know him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You met yesterday at General Kolfort&#8217;s house, and
he considers that you insulted him. Will you be good
enough to tell me who will act for you? The facts
have been explained to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that the lieutenant wishes to force
a quarrel upon me? I remember him now, of course;
but I know of no insult, and certainly I have no
quarrel with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain raised his eyebrows and shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I say, then, that you prefer to apologise?&#8221;
he asked, superciliously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; I returned sharply, stung by his
manner. &#8220;What I mean is that nothing passed which
need make another encounter between us necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is an <i>impasse</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot help that,&#8221; said I, indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you must either fight, sir, or refuse to fight;
and in the latter case the lieutenant says he will be
driven to the extreme course of publicly insulting
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is monstrous,&#8221; I answered angrily. &#8220;It is
nothing less than forcing a quarrel upon me, as I say.
But if that is the lieutenant&#8217;s mood, and he wishes for
another lesson in swordsmanship, I&#8217;ll give it him. I
have but very few friends here in Sofia, but the matter
shall be arranged without delay. Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I
looked across at Spernow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I be of any assistance, Count?&#8221; he said,
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be deeply obliged if you will. Perhaps
these gentlemen will retire to another room for a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
minutes, and then you can wait on them, and matters
can be put in course before they leave the hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went, and I explained all that was necessary
to Spernow, telling him that I attached little importance
to the affair, and that I had already proved myself
much more than a match for the lieutenant with
the sword; that as the challenged party I should
choose swords; but that the conditions were to be
made as little stringent as possible, so that the fight
could be stopped as soon as either was wounded, however
slightly.</p>

<p>He went away then, and when he returned said that
he had made all arrangements, and that we were to
meet early the next morning at a spot just outside the
town, often used for the purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle Broumoff will take a keen interest
in this business, Count,&#8221; he said, as he was leaving me
later. &#8220;Lieutenant Ristich is an object of her deepest
hatred; and so will the Princess for the matter of
that. He is no favourite of hers either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will say nothing, of course, until it is over;
and you will get a friend to act with you, and perhaps
you will both breakfast with me afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure. You take it coolly, Count,&#8221; he
said as we shook hands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>THE DUEL, AND AFTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a glorious morning, the air crisp, fresh and
clear, when I rose early, and found Spernow waiting
for me in the courtyard of the hotel. He introduced
his friend, Captain Zoiloff, who would act as my other
second in the duel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got Zoiloff to come because he&#8217;s well up in these
matters,&#8221; said Spernow, &#8220;and I&#8217;m not. He&#8217;ll keep us
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not take the affair of the duel seriously; my
bout with Ristich at the General&#8217;s house had shown
me my greater skill, and I had no intention of even
wounding him seriously, and no fear whatever that he
would be able to touch me. I said as much to my
companions as we walked together to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ristich is very mad against you for some reason or
other,&#8221; said Spernow. &#8220;And he&#8217;s a hare-brained chap,
so I should look out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not much of a swordsman,&#8221; put in Zoiloff,
&#8220;but he has one or two clever strokes that have served
him well enough in other affairs of this kind;&#8221; and he
went on to describe them. But he found me a somewhat
inattentive listener, and after a short time the
talk turned to other matters.</p>

<p>We were first on the ground, and Captain Zoiloff
promptly set to work to choose the most suitable spot,
and the positions which we should respectively take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
up. He displayed a manifest relish for the task, and
was evidently an old campaigner in this sort of thing.</p>

<p>He had scarcely concluded his work when the other
party arrived, bringing with them a doctor. They
saluted us formally, and without any delay the seconds
consulted together, decided upon the ground, and selected
the weapons.</p>

<p>While they were thus engaged Ristich and I stood
apart, and I saw that he was very pale and moody-looking,
glancing every now and again at me with
patent ill-feeling and animosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ristich has got his marching orders,&#8221; said Spernow
to me, when he and Zoiloff came to explain what they
had arranged.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is being sent back to Russia, and leaves to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard him declare he wanted to go,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but not in semi-disgrace. He puts it down to
you, and that&#8217;s what makes him so bitter. They tell
me he raged like a fiend when he heard it last night,
and he means mischief.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced across at him. He had thrown off his uniform,
and I saw, too, that his sword-arm was bandaged.
Till that moment I had forgotten all about the wound
I had inflicted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay a moment,&#8221; I cried to my seconds. &#8220;He is
wounded. I can&#8217;t fight a disabled man,&#8221; and I told
them what had occurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his lookout,&#8221; said Zoiloff, in a very business-like
tone. &#8220;He is the challenger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t fight a cripple,&#8221; I said resolutely; and at
that they called the other seconds aside, and a long
conference ensued, in the course of which Ristich was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
more than once consulted. I saw him explaining matters
to his seconds, and flourishing one of the rapiers
to show that he could use it quite well.</p>

<p>&#8220;He insists that the fight must go on,&#8221; said Zoiloff
on his return to me, &#8220;and I really don&#8217;t see that you
can object.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t fair,&#8221; I protested. &#8220;Under ordinary
circumstances, and with the full use of his arm, the man
isn&#8217;t my equal with the sword, and, disabled in that
way, the thing&#8217;s absurd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His point is that he has to leave Sofia, and that, as
he is determined to fight you, he will have no other
chance. I shouldn&#8217;t insist, Count Benderoff, if I were
in your place. It will only cause talk. The doctor
has examined the wound and says Ristich is fit to fight,
and he has shown us, as you may have seen, that he
has complete command of his sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes me appear ridiculous to fight a wounded
man,&#8221; I urged. &#8220;Try further protest, and say I will
meet him anywhere at any time when he is well again.
I will travel to Russia if necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid that we shall only get some sneering
reply that you don&#8217;t want to fight, or something of
that sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather be sneered at for not fighting a
wounded man than fight one,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I will take
care of my reputation.&#8221; And they went across to
repeat the protest and deliver the message.</p>

<p>It was as fruitless as the former one, and when Zoiloff
returned he was very angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not repeat his message,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but it
was most insulting. You must fight, Count. If we
have any more conferences we shall only have more
duels. I think you have acted most honourably; but,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
believe me, you can only press this further at great
risk to your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke so earnestly, and Spernow joined with
him, that I allowed myself to be persuaded, and threw
off my coat and waistcoat and made ready.</p>

<p>We took up our positions under the shadow of some
trees, and when my opponent was close to me the look
of hate in his eyes, as they rested on mine, confirmed
what Spernow had told me of his intention and desire
to do his worst.</p>

<p>But from the moment when our blades crossed and
the word was given us to engage, I knew that the issue
must rest with me. Ristich attacked me immediately
with great violence and impetuosity, in the hope of
finishing the matter before his weakened strength
should give out. I had no difficulty in defending myself,
however, and, had I been in the same vengeful
mood as he was, I could have run him through.</p>

<p>My object was not that. I wished merely to wound
him slightly, or disarm him; and I tried two or three
times to do the latter, though without success. I
fought as coolly and warily as if we were in the school
trying a bout with the foils, and this coolness aggravated
my opponent intensely, so that he lost all self-control.</p>

<p>Watching patiently for my opportunity, I found it
when he had made one of his reckless, angry thrusts,
and with a quick counter I drove the point of my
sword into his shoulder. Then I drew back instantly
and threw up my weapon off the guard. Whether he
saw this or not, or whether his rage blinded him to his
wound and to all else besides, I know not, but instantly
he thrust out his weapon with a blow aimed straight
at my heart.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>I saved myself only by springing back, while a shout
of indignation came from Zoiloff.</p>

<p>&#8220;A foul stroke; I call you to witness, gentlemen, a
foul and dastardly stroke,&#8221; he cried, excitedly, as he
rushed in and struck up my opponent&#8217;s sword. &#8220;Count
Benderoff has behaved splendidly, and if your sword
had gone home, Lieutenant Ristich, it would have been
murder. A most foul stroke.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment he was the centre of a group, all as excited
as himself. Ristich protested that he had not
seen me draw back from the fight, that he had not felt
that he was wounded, and that he was eager to continue
the fight. But Zoiloff would not hear of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I withdraw my man, certainly,&#8221; I heard him say,
and he brought matters to a dramatic conclusion. &#8220;I
declare the stroke a foul one, foully dealt, and if anyone
questions that, I am ready to make good my words
now and here;&#8221; and he singled out Captain Dimitrieff
and addressed him pointedly: &#8220;What say you, Captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked very dangerous as he paused for an answer,
and the Captain clearly had no wish for a quarrel
with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, the fight is over,&#8221; he answered, evasively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, and we&#8217;ll leave it at that,&#8221; said Zoiloff,
drily, as he turned on his heel and came to me with
Spernow. &#8220;I never saw a more dastardly thing. I
wouldn&#8217;t have believed even a Russian would have
done such a thing.&#8221; A speech that set me wondering.</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t cross Zoiloff,&#8221; whispered Spernow to
me as I was dressing, rapidly. &#8220;He&#8217;s a demon at the
business. I&#8217;m glad I brought him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he mean about &#8216;even a Russian?&#8217;&#8221; I
asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>&#8220;He hates &#8217;em as much as I do. I&#8217;ll tell you another
time,&#8221; replied Spernow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I congratulate you, Count Benderoff, on a lucky
escape. That man meant to murder you; and Dimitrieff
ought to be ashamed of himself for not speaking
out plainly. But they hang together in a way that&#8217;s
disgusting, these&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He checked himself suddenly,
with a quick glance at me, as though he had said more
than enough before a stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he really did not know I was not on
guard,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s a hope not much stouter than a
spider&#8217;s web;&#8221; and he laughed bitterly. &#8220;The man
meant murder, and was mad when he saw you could
hold him so easily. You use the sword like a master,
Count&mdash;I should like to try the foils with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing would please me better than a few hints
from you,&#8221; said I, readily. &#8220;I am a good deal out of
practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shouldn&#8217;t care to play with you in earnest
when you are in practice,&#8221; was his deftly flattering
reply. &#8220;If we are to quarrel, I&#8217;d better pray for it to
be soon;&#8221; and his taciturn face broke into a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something to earn Zoiloff&#8217;s praise in these
things, Count,&#8221; said Spernow, laughing. &#8220;He&#8217;s generally
as chary of it as a coy woman of her kisses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are both breakfasting with me, I hope,&#8221; I said,
as we moved off the ground. &#8220;Then we can go round
to the house I am getting ready, and, if you like, I can
have my first lesson in the shooting gallery which I
am having fitted up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing would give me greater pleasure; but unfortunately,
as I told Spernow, I have an engagement
which I cannot break,&#8221; said Zoiloff. &#8220;But I can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
with you in about a couple of hours from now, and
then I shall be at your service. I should like nothing
better than to see your gallery.&#8221; And we arranged it
so.</p>

<p>While we were at breakfast I asked Spernow to tell
me, as he had promised, how it was that so much
hatred of the Russians existed among the very men
who were on their side. Such a fact, if it were one,
might have considerable influence upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the worst hand in the world at explaining
things,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But it is quite true. We
don&#8217;t trust them, but we trust each other less, Count;
that&#8217;s about the size of it, I think. We must have
some kind of steady leadership, and what is there
here? Look at the men who are at the head of things,
and what are they except a crowd of nobodies, risen
from nowhere, and setting their course solely by the
compass of self-interest. The needle points always in
that direction, and all the rest goes running round it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why trust Russia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? So far as we can see, the one steady
influence in this country is directed by her. We hate
Russia, but we are afraid of her; and where else can
we look for any hope of help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince,&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is as powerless as his poorest subject, and he
has round him a crew that are after nothing but their
own personal ends. They yell about patriotism and
independence and all the rest of it, but would sell
themselves to-morrow to the highest bidder. They
only don&#8217;t sell themselves, because nobody thinks them
worth buying. The only real power is wielded by
Russia, and I suppose we think it&#8217;s better to make
friends in advance with what must be the controlling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
hand in the country. It&#8217;s not a very high game, is it&mdash;but
where&#8217;s a better? Men like Zoiloff would only
too gladly jump at a chance of something better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Princess Christina?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; And his face lighted with enthusiasm.
&#8220;We do all but worship her, not only for herself, but
because we have come to believe she will in some way
do what we want to see done&mdash;draw out the best that
lies in Bulgarian life. She is truth itself, and right,
justice, and honour are the cardinal articles of her
faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him in surprise and began to see there
was more in him than I had at first thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think more seriously of these matters than I
had believed,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; and he laughed. &#8220;Ah, it does not do for us
Bulgarians to let the Russians believe we take either
our affairs or ourselves too earnestly. But some of us
are sound enough in heart at least. Enough of politics,
however; why should I bore you with them?&#8221;
And he turned away to lighter topics, rattling off a
dozen stories of the latest gossip and tittle-tattle about
the society of the city.</p>

<p>I did not check him, for it struck me that he was
anxious rather that I should retain my first impressions
of him than begin to look on him as taking a serious
interest in the affairs of the country.</p>

<p>After breakfast we went round to my house and I
showed him the alterations I had made. He took the
keenest interest in everything, declaring that my wealth
would make me at once an important figure in Sofia,
and that in a few weeks I should have half the city
flocking to my doors.</p>

<p>When Zoiloff came we went to the shooting gallery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and both the men were vastly interested in everything
I had done. I had had the place fitted as a gymnasium,
with every kind of appliance that money could
provide; many of them sent specially from England.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not know that you Roumanians cared for
these things at all,&#8221; said Zoiloff. &#8220;I have not done
you justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am half an Englishman,&#8221; I answered, purposely&mdash;for
I had begun to alter radically the original part
for which I had cast myself. If I was to stay in Sofia,
I felt that I must wrap round me the protection which
that magic formula, British subject, alone could give.
The announcement surprised them both.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that accounts for it,&#8221; exclaimed Zoiloff. &#8220;You
English are a wonderful people. But why do you
come to Sofia? Pardon me, I have no right to put
such a question,&#8221; he added hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am also half a Roumanian; and the freedom of
Bulgaria is essential for the independence of that
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned away as I spoke, and pretended not to notice
the swift, shrewd look which both men turned
upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall hope to know much more of you, Count
Benderoff,&#8221; said Zoiloff, with so much earnestness that
I thought my words had touched the chord in him I intended.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is my turn to be surprised in you,&#8221; said
Spernow. &#8220;And I hope that we three may come to
understand each other well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Were these invitations from them both to speak
more openly? I thought so, but felt that for the present
I had said enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we try the foils?&#8221; I asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;With pleasure,&#8221; agreed Zoiloff; and while he was
making ready he glanced round the spacious gallery
and added: &#8220;What a magnificent hall you have here;
there is room to drill half a company of soldiers, as well
as train a band of athletes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered with a laugh. &#8220;It would be a
fine house for a revolutionary movement.&#8221; And at
this they both started, and again shot shrewd, searching
glances at me; but I was busy selecting the foils.</p>

<p>&#8220;You English are a wonderful people,&#8221; said Zoiloff
again, but this time very drily.</p>

<p>We set to work then with our fencing, and to my
surprise, and much to Zoiloff&#8217;s admiration, I proved
slightly the better swordsman. He had not a spark of
jealousy or envy in his composition, and when I had
beaten him for the third or fourth bout in succession,
he only laughed and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am your first recruit, Count; and you are a master
I am well content to work from&mdash;and follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; exclaimed Spernow, &#8220;I will be the second&mdash;if
you will have me, Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Spernow, I could wish no better friends
or comrades in any work than you two.&#8221; At this answer
Zoiloff, taciturn and reserved though he was by
nature, offered me his hand impulsively, and said with
great earnestness, as I took it:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I am sure we understand each other, and shall
work together for the same cause, Count;&#8221; and the
warmth of his hand-grip told me that in him I should
have a firm friend.</p>

<p>Spernow was not nearly so skilful a swordsman, and
knew it; but he was anxious to learn, and we arranged
that we three should make a rule of meeting daily for
such practice; and when we were separating I said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;As you can see, I take a great interest in these
things, and I should like you to do me the favour of
bringing with you such friends of yours as you think
would like to come and would help us by taking an
interest in the work here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zoiloff&#8217;s dark eyes lighted meaningly as they held
mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would soon have a large circle of friends,
Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every friend of Bulgaria would be a friend of mine,&#8221;
I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean all that that implies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean all that that implies; and the wider interpretation
you give to it the better I shall be pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It should be a day of good omen for the country
when your house is thrown open for that purpose. A
party of really patriotic Bulgarians is no mere dream-project&mdash;though
they will be young men, mostly. By
Heavens, but I am glad Spernow induced me to go out
with you this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had gone, I stayed to think over all the
chances which this unexpected turn of matters suggested.
It might yet be checkmate indeed to Russian
plans, if we could find the means to form such a party
of young ardent patriots from within the very ranks
of those supposed to be devoted to Russian interests.
There were possibilities calculated to satisfy the wildest
ambitions and effect the most drastic changes.</p>

<p>It would be a perilous task enough at the outset, for
I could not doubt that, should the project get wind,
as was most probable in that land of spies and treachery,
General Kolfort would spare no efforts and stop at no
measures to crush it under the wheels of his enormous
power.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>But it was worth the effort. To me it was infinitely
more welcome than any secret counter-mining intrigue,
such as I had had in contemplation. It would be a
real sturdy stroke in the cause of freedom, and, if once
successful, no man could tell how far or wide or deep
its glorious effects might not be felt.</p>

<p>It roused me till the blood coursed quickly through
my veins and my pulse beat with feverish throbs, for
in it I saw the real interest and honour of the Princess
Christina herself. The men who had been with me
were both pledged to the eyelids to serve her, I knew;
and I knew further that every man they brought to the
house to join us would have the same enthusiasm in
her behalf. Who could tell but that by these means
I might yet be the agent to place her on the throne,
but without the hampering restrictions of any Russian
marriage?</p>

<p>This thought was whirling in my head as I walked
back to my hotel, there to receive another startling
surprise.</p>

<p>Some one was waiting to see me, had been waiting
for two hours, on important business.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Major Grueff, and am the bearer of a letter to
Count Benderoff, of Radova. Have I the pleasure of
speaking to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, what is it?&#8221; I asked, concealing my surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Highness has given you a captain&#8217;s commission
in the Sofia Regiment, Count, of which I am the
Major in command, and has requested me to carry back
your answer to this letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>I opened it and found it a request that I should wait
upon the Prince on the following day.</p>

<p>There was no doubt as to the meaning of this. It
was the Countess Bokara&#8217;s work; and as I penned my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
reply, that I should gladly accept his command, I called
to mind her declaration that our next meeting would
be at the Prince&#8217;s palace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to welcome you to the regiment, Count,&#8221;
said the major; but he spoke in a tone I did not like,
and I conceived an instinctive but invincible prejudice
against him. &#8220;And, as I have been so long waiting,
I will get you to excuse my hurrying away.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not attempt to stay him; for I wished to be
alone to think over this new development.</p>

<p>If I accepted the captaincy, what could it mean except
that I committed myself to the Prince&#8217;s side? And
this at the very moment when the other and vastly
more congenial plan had begun to take shape in my
mind.</p>

<p>I thought I could see again the alluring but cruel
face of the Countess Bokara, and hear the ring of
triumph in her voice as she had turned to me after her
cold-blooded deed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you will have to join us!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>AT THE BALL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ball that night was a very brilliant affair, and
when I arrived the rooms were already somewhat
crowded. I found Spernow waiting for me near the
entrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a little late, Count; we began to fear that
perhaps you were not coming. Mademoiselle Broumoff
is anxious for me to present you at once. Will
you come with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>As we threaded our way through the throng, he told
me the names of many of those present, but I was
looking everywhere for the Princess, and felt disappointed
at not seeing her.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Broumoff was sitting alone in a corner
at the far end, and I saw her eyes light up as she
caught sight of us. She was not pretty, but her face
was bright and clever, with an ever-changing play of
expression that made it very attractive; while a pair
of deeply set thoughtful eyes spoke of great intelligence.</p>

<p>As soon as I had been presented, she made a place
for me at her side and sent Spernow away with a reminder
that he had a number of duty dances with important
partners.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have kept him from them so long, Count, that
he will have a busy time,&#8221; she said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have kept him? I have but this minute arrived.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>&#8220;Of course, that is the reason. I had commissioned
him to bring you straight to me, and you are late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not know that such an honour was depending
on my arrival, or I would have been earlier,&#8221; I said
with a bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been most anxious, and half feared you
meant to disappoint us;&#8221; and in a light strain we
chatted pleasantly. I soon perceived that my companion
was bent upon creating a favourable impression,
while on my side I was not less desirous of making a
friend of one who was so close an intimate of the
Princess. We danced the next waltz together, and at
the close of it she asked me to lead her to one of the
conservatories.</p>

<p>I observed that she was careful to select a quiet corner,
where we could speak without fear of being
overheard, and after a moment&#8217;s pause she said earnestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been really anxious to know you, Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am flattered,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not that,&#8221; she replied impulsively, with a slight
shake of the head. &#8220;I mean more than that. Michel
has told me all that has passed between you&mdash;especially
this morning at your new house. Captain Zoiloff is a
man to trust implicitly, you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I formed that opinion strongly,&#8221; I said, beginning
to wonder what she was going to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Michel tells me you are half English. Is that a
secret?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, certainly not. We English are not afraid to
own our nationality, as the actions of many of us
show too prominently sometimes, I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Englishmen of wealth do not commonly choose
Bulgaria as a place of residence&mdash;at least not without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
some strong motive.&#8221; And her eyes searched my face
for the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eccentricity has never yet been denied to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it in your case eccentricity&mdash;only?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am also half a Roumanian,&#8221; I said, repeating the
answer I had given in the morning to Zoiloff.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Roumanians are all but Russians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is not the Princess Christina a Roumanian?&#8221; I retorted.
&#8220;And also of the Russian Party here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that?&#8221; she asked quickly, turning
the battery of her eyes full on me again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time or means have I had to learn how to
distinguish between appearances and facts?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed&mdash;a very silvery, sweet laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You fence as cleverly with your tongue as with
your sword, Count. What do you want to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing that cannot be told me voluntarily,
mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do we all trust you instinctively?&#8221; she asked.
A quiet feminine thrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am happy if you do,&#8221; I parried; and at the reply
she shrugged her shoulders, and a shadow of impatience
crossed her expressive face.</p>

<p>There was a pause, in which she looked down and
played with her fan.</p>

<p>&#8220;We wish to trust you entirely,&#8221; she said next, in a
low, earnest voice. &#8220;The Princess wishes it.&#8221; A swift
glance shot up to notice the effect of this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no more earnest wish in life than to serve
the Princess,&#8221; I declared, the words coming from my
heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;To serve her is to serve the cause of freedom and
the cause of Bulgaria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Freedom as the Russians interpret it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;Freedom as the English love it,&#8221; she answered, in
a tone that vibrated with enthusiasm, her eyes flashing
and her cheeks colouring. &#8220;The freedom that we true
Bulgarians read and dream of, crave and would die
for,&#8221; she added, her voice deep and low with feeling.</p>

<p>A long pause followed, in which my thoughts were
busy. Had the Princess Christina inspired this feeling,
and was this strange girl an agent in pressing me to
join such a movement? My heart beat fast at the
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a cause you would serve, Count?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are strange things to hear from those whom
I find all gathered under the wings of the Russian
Eagle!&#8221; I said cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be stranger yet to hear,&#8221; she returned
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince who is on your throne is no friend of
Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince has never gained the confidence of true
Bulgarians. The men he keeps about him are patriots
in nothing but name; and he has neither the wit to
winnow the false from the true, nor the courage to set
the false at defiance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would play for a big stake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And make our lives the counters. Is not that
enough?&#8221; The retort was given with a show of bitterness.
&#8220;You English are cold and calculating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are cautious, certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you should hate the Russians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one has accused us of loving them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made another pause before replying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I have been too rash and have surprised
you; but we thought from what Michel told me of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
what passed this morning at your house, that&mdash;well,
that all was as we wished, and that you were already
with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought this?&#8221; I asked, purposely putting
an emphasis on the pronoun. She understood me and
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess and I both thought it,&#8221; and I heard
this with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not hear more than the truth, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we are to be friends in it all?&#8221; she cried;
and her face was radiant with pleasure as she turned
her eyes once more full upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me how I can serve the Princess, and I will
do it with my whole heart, and if need be with my
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will be here to-night, and you can tell her.
The news will have the pleasanter savour coming
direct from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew how to fire me, and I would have given
half my fortune to have known what lay behind the
meaning glance of her eyes, which started thoughts I
would not silence, and yet dared not indulge.</p>

<p>As I sat there, half bewildered, I saw a tall, fair, truculent-looking
man forcing his way arrogantly among
the people and coming in our direction, while he
looked about him on all sides in search of someone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man to fear, Count&mdash;the worst enemy we have,
Duke Sergius. A man whose eyes we have always to
blind.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment he caught sight of my companion
and he hurried his pace, a heavy frown darkening his
sensual, insolent features.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>&#8220;I have had much trouble in finding you, mademoiselle.
I might almost have thought you were trying
to avoid me. The waltz we were to dance together
has commenced.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Broumoff smiled ingenuously at him
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I scarcely thought you were in earnest when you
put my name on your programme. You do not generally
honour me by remembering it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something particular to ask you,&#8221; he replied,
with such selfish insolence that I could have kicked
him. He caught something of this expression in my
face as he looked casually at me, and his glance deepened
into a steady stare as he tried to frown me down.
But I returned his look with one in which I tried to
convey some of the dislike and contempt I felt at his
attitude, and, perceiving it, mademoiselle rose hastily,
put herself between us, and drew his attention by
placing her hand on his arm and saying, as she bowed
to me:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready now.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they moved off I heard him ask who I was, but
could not catch the reply.</p>

<p>I hated the look of the man, and tried to persuade
myself that the feeling was not in any way prompted
by what I knew about his design upon the Princess
Christina. If I had before needed any inducement to
drive me into opposition to him, my hasty prejudice
would have supplied it; and I sat now absorbed in
thought, chewing the cud of all that had passed between
the Princess&#8217;s staunch little emissary and myself,
and wishing for the hour and the means to thwart
him. They would come, I felt, and I nursed my anger
and fed my animosity as I sat there piecing together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the threads of the net that was closing round me, and
drawing me forward upon a path that would lead I
could not say whither.</p>

<p>Spernow&#8217;s voice roused me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not dancing, Count. Won&#8217;t you let me
find you some partners? There are plenty here who
wish to know you. Well, have you and Nathalie
had an interesting conversation?&#8221; he asked in a lower
voice, dropping into the seat at my side. &#8220;I know
how anxious she was for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope great things from it,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you to be presented to the Princess?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him in surprise, not understanding the
question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the presentation was to hinge upon the result
of your talk with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then probably I shall be presented,&#8221; I returned,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, very good; nothing could be better, indeed.
Come, then, and let us go in search of partners. But
don&#8217;t fill up your card, you may need a gap or two in
it presently.&#8221; I guessed his meaning, but said nothing
as I went with him back to the dancing hall, was
introduced to several people, and for an hour danced
and chatted as though I had no other object in life.</p>

<p>I was not too much engrossed by my partners, however,
to miss the entrance of the Princess Christina,
and more than once when I passed close to her in the
course of a dance I caught her gaze fixed upon me
with evident interest. Once especially was I certain
of this, when she and Mademoiselle Broumoff were in
close and earnest conversation; and it was with a thrill
of pleasure that I felt that I was the subject of their
talk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Soon after this Spernow came to me and said that
the Princess was anxious that I should be presented
to her; and with a fast-quickening pulse I went with
him to where she and her companion were sitting.</p>

<p>Almost directly I had made my bow Mademoiselle
Broumoff rose and said to Spernow:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is our dance, Michel,&#8221; and as the pair went
away I took her place by the side of the beautiful
woman who exercised so overpowering a fascination
upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;A more conventional meeting than our first, Count,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;A very brilliant scene,&#8221; I replied na&iuml;vely; for now
that I was alone with her I felt like a tongue-tied
clown. My stupid answer surprised her, as well it
might, and I saw a look of perplexity cross her face.
After an awkward pause, I added: &#8220;Your coming
then saved my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scarcely that; but I have since heard the particulars
of that matter, and I have been ashamed that you
should have suffered such treatment in my name. I
am glad of an opportunity of assuring you of my
regret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would gladly suffer much worse on your behalf,&#8221;
I blurted out nervously, and the answer brought another
pause, during which I struggled hard to overcome
my embarrassment and self-consciousness. I
desired above all things in the world to win the favour
of my companion, and yet I sat like a fool, at a loss
for the mere commonplaces of conversation. She
would think me a dolt or an idiot.</p>

<p>How long my stupid silence would have lasted I
cannot tell; but the Princess in a movement of her
fan dropped her dance card, and, in returning it to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
I looked up, and caught her eyes upon me lighted with
a rare smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you return it to me without your name upon
it?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I have the honour?&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is a ball for, but dancing?&#8221; she smiled.
&#8220;But if you write your name there it will be a sign
and token.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what?&#8221; I asked stupidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of much that my dear little friend Mademoiselle
Broumoff tells me she has said to you to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is a ball for, but dancing?&#8221; I repeated her
words as I took the card and wrote my initials against
a waltz. &#8220;It will make the dance memorable to me,&#8221;
I added, under my breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall read it for one thing as a token that you
have acquitted me of all responsibility for the scene at
General Kolfort&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no need for any token of that, Princess,&#8221;
I replied, beginning to shake off my paralysing nervousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;And of the rest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I desire nothing better than to be enrolled
among your friends.&#8221; I spoke from my heart then,
and the words pleased her.</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be many dangers, and more difficulties.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am prepared for both&mdash;if I can serve you.&#8221; I
looked straight at her for the first time, and her eyes
fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could have no more welcome friend,&#8221; she said
softly.</p>

<p>This time the pause that followed was due as much
to her embarrassment as to mine, and I noted this with
a touch of delight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>&#8220;You had a long conference with General Kolfort?&#8221;
she asked, a minute later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he threatened me with all the power of his
enmity if I did not decide to ally myself on his side,
and gave me a week in which to do so or leave the
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your decision?&#8221; she asked quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has been made to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To do what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To devote myself without reserve to your interests.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad&mdash;and proud.&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer that she could have made could have
filled me with more supreme pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had feared a quite different result from news
which reached me to-day. You know your affairs are
pretty freely discussed just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What news was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard that you had received a captain&#8217;s commission
in the Prince&#8217;s own household regiment. Is that
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was unsolicited by me; and I learnt it only to-day.
I have not yet accepted it. I am to see His
Highness to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find him a good man, but sorely distracted
by doubts and fears. All willing to serve
Bulgaria; but afraid of Russian influence, and unable
to choose good advisers here. His nerves have been
shaken by the plots against his life, and his judgment
shattered till he cannot appraise the men about him.
Were matters different he would be an ideal ruler for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what of the other influences round him?&#8221; I
asked guardedly; but she understood me and replied
openly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;You mean the woman whose life you saved. I cannot
understand her. Her ruling passion seems to be
her hate of me. And a woman with a passion, be it
jealousy, hate, or love, is no safe guide.&#8221; I detected a
note of sadness in her tone. &#8220;You ran a great risk
that night, Count, a fearful risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was little danger that I saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not mean the seen danger; that may have
been small for a man whose bravery and skill with
weapons are such as yours. But the unseen dangers&mdash;the
consequences that may always pursue and overtake
you when you least think of them. It is such terrible
deeds as that which fill me with dismay and dread of
the future. How can a cause hope to prosper, the
foundations of which are secret murder, implacable
violence, and such desperate bloodshed? And these
things are done in my name, and apparently with my
sanction. Did not General Kolfort threaten you with
the consequences of your act?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I do not take his threats too seriously. It
is one thing to assassinate a Bulgarian woman, another
to murder a British subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you have been longer in this distracted
country you will see the distinction differently. But
we must talk no longer in this strain here. Too many
eyes are upon us and too many ears open. Balls are
for dancing, Count,&#8221; she added in a light tone and with
a smile.</p>

<p>I understood that I was dismissed, and rose and
walked away. I was in no mood for dancing, and I
went into one of the conservatories to think over what
had passed between us, and remained there until it was
time to claim her for the waltz she had promised me.</p>

<p>We danced it almost in silence, save for a commonplace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
or two about the ball and the people present;
but at the close she said earnestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am leaving almost directly. I shall be at home
to-morrow afternoon, and shall be interested to know
your impressions of the Prince.&#8221; Then in a lower
voice: &#8220;You must be careful, Count. Accept the
commission in the regiment; but do not pledge yourself
to His Highness&#8217;s service. You will not find it
necessary. Maintain as strict a neutrality as possible;
and then see General Kolfort and tell him what you
are doing. It might be well to see him before you go
to the Palace. Emphasise the fact of your British
nationality. You have a difficult part to play; how
difficult you do not yet see, perhaps. But your success
and your safety will always be of the deepest concern
to me. Remember that, always.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke earnestly, and in her eyes, as I glanced
into them, I saw again that look of solicitude which at
our previous meeting had moved me so strangely.</p>

<p>And the sweetness of her voice, the touch of her
hand, and the tender softness of her glance, were
haunting me all through the night, and urging me to I
know not what strenuous efforts in her behalf.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>AT THE PALACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning I was up early and went for a long
ride. It was likely to be a critical day for me, and I
had to try and look well ahead to see where I was
being carried by the new set of the tide in my affairs.</p>

<p>My conversation with the Princess Christina had
had a great effect upon me. For one thing it had
made me more resolved than ever to devote myself to
her, whatever might be the consequences; but her
words of warning, her evident belief that there was
danger for me, and above all her pleasure at my
declaration of loyalty to her, had roused all my instincts
of caution, while they had strengthened my
feelings towards her.</p>

<p>She was shrewd, clear-cut in her views of men and
things, devoted to the cause of Bulgaria, and openly
allied to the Russian party, whose rough and violent
methods she had nevertheless so indignantly decried.
What then was her object? Was she playing the
doubly hazardous game of attempting to use the Russian
influence and power for an end opposed to theirs?</p>

<p>That was the only solution I could see. And it was
one which I knew must involve her in a course fraught
with such peril, that only a woman of iron nerve and
implacable will could contemplate it without fear.
And yet she was brave enough to take such a course
without, so far as I knew, a single man trained in state-craft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
and intrigue to help her. Could I take such a
<i>r&ocirc;le</i>? The mere thought of the possibility filled me
with enthusiasm not unmixed with much embarrassment.</p>

<p>If my surmise was right, I felt that her scheme was
just that which our Foreign Office would do their
utmost to assist; and, in helping her to gain the throne
on such terms, I should be fulfilling in the best possible
way the object of my presence in the country.
But I knew, too, that open help from the British Government
was impossible. That had been made unmistakably
plain to me, and I must make it equally clear to
her. Her advice to make the most of my British
nationality might have been prompted by a belief that
our Government would help her, and I must show her
the groundlessness of any such hope.</p>

<p>At the same time, the course she had indicated
agreed best with my own views: to maintain an open
neutrality between the contending sections while devoting
myself to her interests. Her whole object must
be put fully before me, however; and I resolved to
speak very frankly that afternoon. The prospect of
the close association with her was infinitely alluring,
and it required more than a single effort to drag my
thoughts away from dwelling upon this to the more
practical consideration of other matters. To secure
that friendship I would willingly venture all that I
had in the world; and I had but to think of it for my
heart to be thrilled and my senses dazzled.</p>

<p>But what of the Duke Sergius and the story of the
secret betrothal? The man was a selfish, sensual brute,
as I had seen for myself. Was it possible that she
would even go to the length of sacrificing herself in a
marriage with such a man to secure her end? Then I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
recalled a sentence of Mademoiselle Broumoff&#8217;s: &#8220;A
man whose eyes we have always to blind;&#8221; and I
repeated it over and over again, till at last I grew to
read it by the light of my own wild, vague thoughts
and hopes&mdash;that there was no betrothal, but that the
pretended agreement to it was a part of the subtler
plot which my Princess was weaving. The thought of
such a betrothal was maddening to me, and I worked
myself up until I thought I would rather pick a quarrel
with him and run him through the heart than see her
condemned to be the wife of such a brute.</p>

<p>I was cooler, however, when I returned to my hotel,
and my wits were clear and wary enough as I set out
for General Kolfort&#8217;s house. I was well received, but
he made haste to show me that he knew already of the
fact of my captain&#8217;s commission.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you, Count Benderoff&mdash;or shall I
say Captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Choose your own form of salutation, General. It
was of that matter I came to see you,&#8221; I returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All?&#8221; I asked, as if in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you accept the commission in the service of the
Prince&mdash;or rather of the lady who has offered it you&mdash;or
in mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In neither; but as an honour offered to a rich
British subject who has taken up permanent residence
in Sofia.&#8221; His shrewd old eyes lighted at this reply,
which he had certainly not expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that is your line, eh?&#8221; he said drily. &#8220;Considering
that they know nothing of the Hon. Mr.
Winthrop&#8217;s existence, they have acted a little by accident
in honouring a British subject. Don&#8217;t you
think so?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>I smiled. &#8220;At any rate they have made me the offer,
and I have decided to accept it. But I preferred to
come and tell you, after our interesting little conversation
of three days ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That means, then, you will remain in Sofia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My house is nearly ready for my occupation, and I
shall hope to be honoured by your presence in it as my
guest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph! You have not forgotten our conversation,
I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was scarcely one to be forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I understand you claim the rights of a British
subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am half a Roumanian, General, with considerable
possessions there,&#8221; I returned, equivocally.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a very ambitious, or a very reckless, or a
very clever young man, Count. You have thought over
your course well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not given to act on impulse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet cleverer men than you have tried unsuccessfully
the dangerous policy of attempting to ride on two
horses at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can but fail,&#8221; I answered, indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you decline to enrol yourself in my service?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I neither decline nor accept, General.&#8221; The reply
was unwelcome, and he sat a moment with brows
knitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will fail, sir, as certainly as you make the attempt.
But I must know, in view of future possibilities,
whether you claim the status of a British subject or that
of a Roumanian Count, or whether, again, I am to regard
you merely as a captain in a Bulgarian regiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be in the unique position of enjoying all
three,&#8221; said I, and noticed with some amusement the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
effect of this answer; and then added with a laugh, and
in a light tone: &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect you to take me too
seriously, General Kolfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are a British subject, I can ask your Government
to recall you; if a Roumanian Count, I can use
other influence to deal with you; while, if you are
merely a Bulgarian officer, you will be responsible to
me for the deed which you have already committed.&#8221;
His tone was tense, concentrated, and full of earnestness.
&#8220;Understand me; I do not alter. If you will not join
me, you shall not stay in Bulgaria. I am not to be trifled
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can appreciate that, for you have already had my
correspondence tampered with, in order to prevent certain
news reaching England. I have committed no act
for which I am not quite prepared to answer&mdash;openly;
and all I demand is that fair play which we English
claim as the right of all&mdash;whether English, Roumanian,
or Bulgarian.&#8221;</p>

<p>He listened to this with a grim smile on his hard face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that you are ready to risk breaking yourself
on the wheel. Very well; I confess I looked for
a somewhat different decision, judging by what has
passed in the last two days&mdash;your conversations
with various people; but remember, and, indeed, you
are not likely to forget, what I have told you is my firm
resolve. If you stay, you must join us.&#8221;</p>

<p>I left him then, feeling that I had created pretty
much the impression I desired&mdash;that, in dealing with
me, he would have to regard me as a British subject;
and that, coupled with the fact of my increasingly close
relations with the Princess and those about her, would
suffice to secure my safety for a time.</p>

<p>With the reigning Prince I was at a loss what line to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
take. It was difficult to decide beforehand; but I was
resolved to go to the length of refusing the captaincy in
the regiment if the conditions attached to its acceptance
were in any way embarrassing to my freedom.</p>

<p>But my interview with him was a surprise to me.</p>

<p>He received me alone, and spoke with a freedom I
had not expected, giving as the reason for his attitude
my rescue of the Countess Bokara; and when I told
him as I did, for there was now no longer any reason
for concealing the fact, that I was an Englishman, his
frankness increased. He jumped to the conclusion that
I had some sort of credentials from the British Government,
and it was only with difficulty that I disabused
him of the idea.</p>

<p>He had the most engaging personality of any man I
ever met. He was strikingly handsome; every movement
was marked by a courtly but unstudied and
natural grace; his voice was toned in perfect accord
with his courteous and kindly bearing; and his manner
so sympathetically receptive as to impress you with the
conviction that all you said had the utmost interest and
importance for him. A courtier to the finger-tips, and
yet withal a prince, it was impossible not to be charmed
with him. I might have been his most intimate friend
instead of the merest stranger who had come to thank
him for a favour just bestowed. There was something
lacking, however&mdash;strength; and therein, without doubt,
lay the secret of his failure.</p>

<p>&#8220;What reason can a wealthy Englishman have for
settling in a place like this, unless he bears a commission
of some kind?&#8221; he asked, while indulging his hope
that I was indeed charged with the duty of aiding him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had I such a mission, your Highness, should I not
have come straight to you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;I suppose so, but yet it seems strange. I suppose
they know in England how matters are with me, and
what must eventually happen if nothing is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All Europe knows of the difficulties of your position,&#8221;
I answered diplomatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;And all Europe does nothing but look on with
folded hands, leaving me helpless to kick against the
pricks. Do they think I bear a charmed life to withstand
for ever the plots against my life that are being
daily formed, and that I can go on for ever avoiding
the poison or the dagger or the bullet that my enemies
have ever in readiness for me? Do they take me for
a zealot so tired of living that I am willing to keep my
life always on offer to the first hand daring and shrewd
enough to take it? And all this for a freedom which
they mouth about and will not help, and for a people
who have been corrupted to hate me, though I have
doubled their country, led them to victory, and saved
them from overwhelming disasters. By Heaven! the
ingratitude of this people is as colossal as their selfishness.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said nothing, and in a moment his bitterness
passed, and he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is poor hearing for one who has come generously
to offer me his services, and who has already
placed me under a load of obligation. But at least I
will be frank with you, Count Benderoff. I can give
you this commission, give it gladly, and welcome you
for what I believe you to be&mdash;an honourable man; but
your services are of no use to me. They come too
late&mdash;too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand your Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall not be for want of plain dealing with you,
then. The dear friend whose life you saved, and who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
has brought you to me, is urging&mdash;the impossible. She
does not know it, or cannot realise it, or will not&mdash;what
you will; but, mark me well, my days in this ungrateful
country are numbered. You will not use the information
I give you&mdash;but I have resolved to abdicate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To abdicate?&#8221; I cried, for this was news indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; to abdicate. That is my fixed and irrevocable
resolve. Had you brought me the promise of help
from England, I would stay and fight it out, and strive
to realise those high hopes with which, under God, I
declare I accepted the throne. But what can I do
alone, or almost alone, against a people who plot and
plan to depose or murder me, who have tired already
of the puppet ruler which other Powers imposed upon
them, and against the cursed canker of this Russian
intrigue? In all the land I cannot now tell who is
friend and who foe. In my very household the air
reeks with conspiracy and intrigue. I know not
whether any man I meet by chance may not be sent
to do murder. I never lie down at night without wondering
whether I shall see the next morning&#8217;s sun. I
never taste a meal without the thought of poison. I
never speak a word without the expectation that it will
be carried to the ears of my implacable and ruthless
foes. And never a sun rises and sets again without I
know that the deadly work of corruption has been carried
a stage farther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such thoughts as these, your Highness, grow by
brooding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God, man, they are the natural germs with
which this Eastern air is crowded and polluted. No,
no; these are no idle fears. Russia is relentless, and
I am powerless to resist her. I will not be her tool.
I could stay in safety and in what the world calls pomp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
and honour, a great Prince, if I would but stoop to
do her bidding. I will not; and therefore my choice to
abdicate or die. Would God it could have been different!&#8221;</p>

<p>I was silent in the rush of thoughts these utterances
roused.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not tell the Countess Bokara this? It is
my grief, the bitterest irony of all my position, that I
am driven thus to mislead the one friend who has been
staunch to me, the truest friend God ever gave to a
disappointed man, a foiled and thwarted Prince. I
have told you&mdash;it will, indeed, be public knowledge in
a few weeks from now, and Europe will reap the crop
which her vacillation has sown&mdash;that you may not be
buoyed up with false hopes from this grant of the
commission. It would be a Greek gift, indeed, did I
not tell you the truth&mdash;that you have nothing to hope
from it. I can guess, of course, what the result will
be. You will be drawn to the Russian net. That is
a vortex which sucks in everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned like a needle to the magnet as I heard the
ringing tones of the Countess Bokara, who had entered
the room unknown to us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who will join the Russian party&mdash;you, Count Benderoff?&#8221;
she cried eagerly, almost fiercely, as she came
quickly forward. &#8220;No. Prince, I will answer for him.
He dare not,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much did you hear, Anna?&#8221; he asked rather
uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough to rouse my indignation, that was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was telling the Count that there is no hope to be
gained in my service, and there is but one side here
for a man of action.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;Prince, Prince, why will you always damp the
enthusiasm of those who would be your friends and
adherents? Why this constant tone of depression?
These everlasting fears and forebodings? There is no
cause for them, Count. We are on the eve of a stroke
that will change everything&mdash;everything&mdash;and foil
these coward traitors and restore in all its former
strength the Prince&#8217;s influence. There is no monopoly
of craft and guile in these Russians! A clear head, a
strong hand, a loyal heart, and a daring sword, can change
all. We are not so hopeless but that a clever <i>coup</i> can
save our cause and make us once again all-powerful.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince threw up his hands with a gesture of
weakness.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too late,&#8221; he murmured, despondently. &#8220;Too
late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall never be too late while I live,&#8221; she cried,
desperately. &#8220;It shall never be said that you were
beaten by a woman. Force her from the path, by fair
means or foul&mdash;and forced she shall be&mdash;and all the
flimsy superstructure of this clumsy plot falls like a
shattered dream. Never shall Bulgaria be crushed
beneath that woman&#8217;s heel while I have strength in my
right arm, or there remains a knife or a bullet in all the
land. I swear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She uttered the vengeful words with all the vehement
force of her violent temper, and as I looked at
her I could see the thoughts of murder lighting her
strained, glowing features, and brightly gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>But while they stirred repugnance in me they seemed
only to add to the Prince&#8217;s despondency.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been too much blood shed already,&#8221; he
said, in a tone of rebuke.</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;THE COUNT HAS MY PERMISSION TO RETIRE.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Page <a href="#Page_89">89</a>.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>&#8220;Too much; aye, so much that one woman&#8217;s life
more will make no difference. So they thought when
they planned that mine should be the life&mdash;and shall I
be softer than they?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince looked at me with an expression I was
quick to read, and I made a movement as if to leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall see you again shortly, Count, and you will
take up your military duties at your early convenience.
Meanwhile, I depend upon your discretion. All that
you have heard here is for yourself alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely. I understand,&#8221; I answered, and took
my leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot go like this,&#8221; broke in the Countess.
&#8220;I have yet much to say to you. I need your advice
and help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame, I have urgent matters that call for attention
immediately,&#8221; I replied, and the Prince thanked
me with a look.</p>

<p>&#8220;And are not these matters urgent?&#8221; she cried,
indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count has my permission to retire,&#8221; said the
Prince, with sudden dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you return, sir?&#8221; asked the Countess. &#8220;I
must see you at once. I cannot brook delay. I am on
fire when I think of all you must help me to achieve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My duties will bring me here constantly;&#8221; and as
I withdrew I could not decide whether my admiration
of her courage and staunchness to the Prince or my
loathing of the deadly methods by which she was prepared
to prove it were the greater. Admirable as a
friend, she was hateful as a woman; and as she watched
me go she appeared like a beautiful dangerous fiend,
till her face turned to the Prince and her eyes glowed
with the intense love for him which was the inspiring
passion of her strange, reckless nature.</p>

<small>&#8220;I HAVE UNBOUNDED FAITH IN YOU&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> my impressions of the interview with the Prince
were quickly overshadowed by the one overpowering
fear that the Princess was in imminent personal danger
from the fury of the Countess Bokara. The Princess
was regarded by her as the central pivot on which the
whole Russian intrigue turned, and to take her life
was the openly avowed object of that dangerous
woman&#8217;s passion.</p>

<p>That any attempt would be subtly planned and fearlessly
carried out I knew well enough, and it was for
the perfecting of such a scheme that she sought my
help. This was indeed the crowning irony of the situation.
I, who would give my life to save the Princess&#8217;s,
was to be this reckless fury&#8217;s accomplice in a
plot to murder her, in order to keep on the throne a
Prince who had solemnly declared to me his unalterable
decision to resign it.</p>

<p>Yet there was one ray of consolation. It was probable
that I should be able to hold her scheme in check
long enough to secure the safety of her intended
victim, and I could at once urge upon the latter the
necessity for the greatest caution. It was with this
thought in my mind that I made my visit to the
Princess in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Her house was a large one standing by itself in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
centre of the town, and I scanned it curiously. I
noticed with satisfaction that great precautions had
been taken. All the windows in the lower part were
barred heavily; and the defences might have been
planned with the express view of preventing just such
an attempt as was in contemplation. The Russians
had obviously done the work, knowing the need for
guarding jealously the woman on whom so much
depended.</p>

<p>On that score I had no apprehensions, therefore, and
I resolved to question the Princess closely as to the
state of affairs within, and whether she was absolutely
sure of those who formed her household.</p>

<p>She received me very graciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your interview with the Prince has made you
thoughtful, Count,&#8221; she said, after a few minutes.
&#8220;Was my forecast right? and what have you done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have accepted the commission in his regiment,
but I have not pledged myself to support his cause&mdash;indeed,
he said that I should probably find myself
bound in the end to commit myself to the Russian
party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is singular that a man who showed himself so
brave, and at first so capable, should be unable to read
what is as plain as a book to other people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His reading is that the one possible future for the
country is for it to pass into the power of Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that. It is his besetting weakness.&#8221; She
said this very thoughtfully, and then her face and eyes
lighted as she added with vehemence: &#8220;And it is
wrong&mdash;utterly and wholly wrong. The merest counsel
of despair. By the help of Heaven we will live to
prove it so; and if I have not counted on you in vain,
you shall help us in the glorious work.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>She turned her eyes upon me with a look that infected
me with her enthusiasm. &#8220;You will help us,
will you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With everything I possess, even to my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it; I am sure of you. Would to heaven
we had more men like you with us! I am going to
trust you&mdash;put perhaps our lives in your keeping,
for I know well enough the dangers of the work. But
I trust you&mdash;absolutely.&#8221; She held out her hand as
she said this with an air and tone of implicit confidence,
and I carried her fingers to my lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me how to help,&#8221; I said, my voice unsteady
with emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Openly we are all allied to the Russians in a scheme
which is to make me the reigning Princess, independent
of all Russian influence. This is the veil which hides
their real intentions. Secretly there is an engagement
that I shall become the wife of the Duke Sergius,
admitting him to a half share of the throne, and thus
Russianising it completely. To make sure of me, it
is arranged that we be married secretly, the union only
to be announced after my accession. The object for
this is of course to bind me irrevocably to them beforehand;
and it is expected that while I am seemingly
independent, all that is national and patriotic in Bulgaria
will be rallied to my support. We should thus
get a firm hold of the throne and of all classes of the
people without the suspicion of too great Russian
predominance. Do you see that?&#8221;</p>

<p>I did; and my looks showed that I did not relish it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a shrewd scheme, no doubt,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>She gazed at me steadily, almost reproachfully, I
thought. But I did not like the scheme, and would
not pretend that I did.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;Is it a plan you will help?&#8221; she asked. I was silent
and cast my eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a plan you will help?&#8221; she repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;You place me in a position of great difficulty,
Princess,&#8221; I replied, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you help me in it?&#8221; she repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;With such powerful influence behind you, you will
not need my help that I can see,&#8221; I returned, ungraciously,
for the scowling brutal face of Duke Sergius
was in my thoughts.</p>

<p>Her eyes were still bent steadily upon me, and a side
glance showed me their expression had changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not frank with me, Count Benderoff,&#8221; she
said, after a pause; and at that I looked up and said
bluntly:</p>

<p>&#8220;If I offend you I am sorry; but I will not stir a
finger to help the man you mean&mdash;the Duke Sergius.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face was breaking into a smile, when she checked
it, and I saw a faint wave of colour rise to her
cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know of Duke Sergius?&#8221; she asked.
Again a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little or nothing, Madame; but I will not serve in
any cause where his interests are to be advanced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you not like him? You knew I was betrothed
to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>She seemed suddenly bent on rousing my temper
against the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had heard of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet, knowing it, you have not hitherto refused to
help me!&#8221; Was she playing on my passion, that she
persisted in her questioning? &#8220;You must have some
reasons,&#8221; she continued, when I remained silent; &#8220;what
are they?&#8221; and to my astonishment the smile which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
she had before checked now passed beyond control
and lighted her face rarely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not press me for my reasons,&#8221; I said
quickly; and the light in her eyes may have reflected
the thought behind it, for again the colour mantled
her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you will not help me?&#8221; she said in a low
voice that witched me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You? With my life!&#8221;</p>

<p>The passion in my tone made her cast down her
eyes, till, with a still deeper colour on her face, she
lifted them and said gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me; I was but testing you. And if you
blame me, think what store I may set upon an assurance
of fidelity that is purely personal to me. Call it
caprice if you will, a mere woman&#8217;s caprice, that I
should thus seek to probe your real thoughts and
resolves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no need to test me where you were
concerned,&#8221; I replied; and again the earnestness of
my tone appeared to embarrass her. In the short
silence that followed I sat with but the loosest rein
upon the hopes and thoughts that were so much to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; the Duke Sergius does not come into the
scheme as we plan it,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and I thought
indeed that what Mademoiselle Broumoff told you
would have made you understand this. I would do
much for this country; and if it were necessary that I
should marry him&mdash;which, thank God, it is not&mdash;I
might force myself to go even to that extreme. But
in my life there can be no thought of marriage. I
should be baser than the base if, having taken this
charge upon me, I should ever turn from it by any
thought of myself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>She spoke in a tone of lofty exaltation, a strange
contrast indeed to what she had termed her &#8220;mere
woman&#8217;s caprice;&#8221; and I held my peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our plan is this,&#8221; she resumed: &#8220;to use the Russian
ladder, and then kick it over. To make them
pledge themselves before Europe to support me on the
throne, and then to use the power of the throne for
rallying the Bulgarians to defend themselves and their
country against their real enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have mapped out a dangerous counterplot,
Princess; but I like it, and if I can help, I will. How
will you prevent the secret marriage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have to leave that to be disposed of when
the time comes. As you were warned, he is a man
whose eyes we have ever to blind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure of the people about you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of some&mdash;indeed, of many; but it is in that you
can be of such help to us. I have heard of the suggestions
you made so guardedly, that your house shall be
the rendezvous of the movement to which those shall
be brought who are known to be true to the country,
and can be trusted. Such a meeting-place will be invaluable,
especially where, as in your case, there is a
plausible excuse for any such gatherings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We propose to form a kind of gymnasium club&mdash;at
least, propose that you should form it among the
young men of the city whom we can ascertain to be
faithful. Of these men you will necessarily become
the leader; so you see you will have an important part
to play, my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is shrewd,&#8221; I said, perceiving at once its many
possibilities, as I recalled Zoiloff&#8217;s words. &#8220;But how
far are your plans advanced? Time presses.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>&#8220;Much farther advanced than you think. We have
been working all the time this Russian scheme has been
in progress, so that we should be ready when that
reaches its climax. But matters will move faster now,
and in a few weeks all should be prepared. It is a
strong point that the very craft of General Kolfort
itself has helped us. We have, as it were, a free hand
for making our preparations. He is as anxious as we
are that those Bulgarians who are opposed to the
Prince, and would help me, but fear Russia, should be
secured to us; and this has given us just the cover for
our work that we needed. We shall triumph, Count,
for the cause of truth is ours, and Bulgaria shall be
free;&#8221; and her voice rang with earnestness.</p>

<p>I sat silent in thought for some moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have thought of the dangers to yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can but die, and where could one find a nobler
end?&#8221; Her face shone with the light of willing martyrdom.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think the General has no suspicion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He cannot have as yet. There will come a moment
when his eyes will be opened, no doubt, and then
the danger may be real enough. But I am prepared to
face anything for the cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought of that moment, and my heart feared for
her; but I knew of the other danger from that wild
woman, the Countess Bokara; and I must put her on
her guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not of the dangers we must think, Count, but
of the great end to be achieved,&#8221; she added. &#8220;To
dwell on nothing but risks may make cowards of the
bravest.&#8221;</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;SHE TURNED SWIFTLY AND LOOKED AT ME.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Page <a href="#Page_97">97</a>.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;True; but we must at all events give enough heed
to the dangers to be able to guard against them. Have
you thought of the steps the Prince and those about
him might take against you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may have influence with her,&#8221; she answered,
understanding me readily. &#8220;And I have had a half
hope that you may be able to make her understand how
hopeless are her efforts. Can you do this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not hopeful. She is a woman of wild and
vehement passions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is mad; she hates me so violently that if she
dared she would herself plunge a knife into my heart.
She clings to the shadow of power which she wields
through the Prince with all the tenacity of ambition
venomed by malice. I know it, but I do not fear her,&#8221;
she said proudly. &#8220;She is the greatest enemy this
country has, even in this hour when its enemies throng
every street, and are found in every house. Daring,
unscrupulous, reckless, and saturated with the lust of
power, she would use the Prince for the pursuit of her
own ends, and those only, however cleverly masked by
a boasted love of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess was a very woman after all, I saw, for
it was easy to read the personal dislike which breathed
through her indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;She may be very dangerous, Princess,&#8221; I said warningly.</p>

<p>She turned swiftly and looked at me, reading in my
voice my genuine alarm for her. After a moment, her
face softened into a smile, and she put her hand on
my arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are warning me, I see, against something you
know but cannot tell me. I will not ask you. I will
do more, for your sake, and to relieve your fears on my
account. I will be very cautious. You have a most
difficult part to fulfil at present; I understand that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
But I will guard against any such risks as you appear
to contemplate. Your ready zeal for the cause is very
welcome to me, Count&mdash;more welcome, perhaps, than
I have been able to show you. For the sake of what
you say, I will be very cautious.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes rested a moment on my face, holding me
in a thraldom of silent admiration. Then she added
sweetly: &#8220;But you must not let your fears for me
print themselves so legibly on your face. We shall go
forward together in this matter to victory, my friend.
That is the thought to carry with you. Heaven will
not suffer us to fail, let the risks and difficulties be what
they may. We are close comrades now; and I feel that
you have been sent just at the moment when such a
man was absolutely necessary. And when we have
gained the victory, you will play a large part in the far
greater work that lies ahead. I have unbounded faith
in you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not need the spur of ambition to serve you,
Princess; but, by the help of heaven, your faith in me
shall never prove unfounded.&#8221; I spoke with intense
earnestness, and then rose to leave. She rose, too, and
gave me her hand, which I again carried to my lips;
and it pleased me to think that her fingers trembled
as my lips touched them.</p>

<p>I had reached the door when she said suddenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there is one thing which I have not mentioned.
We have a kind of watchword which you
should know. Our friends are banded together &#8216;In
the Name of a Woman,&#8217; Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>I started with a touch of alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;But General Kolfort knows of that. It was with
that formula I was accosted by the messenger who led
me to his house.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>&#8220;He chose it,&#8221; she answered, with a smile of reassurance.
&#8220;It is intended to mark off those who are
for me as distinguished from those solely devoted to
Russia, the good men and true for whom he thinks I
can best act as his decoy.&#8221; I understood her. &#8220;You
will not forget it and all that it means, as I have explained
to you to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not likely to forget all that it means to me,&#8221;
I said, and a quick glow on her face made me think she
understood me, too, and was not displeased. With a
little flush of pleasure I turned again to leave, when
the door was opened, and a servant announced the
Duke Sergius.</p>

<p>He came in hurriedly, with a look of vexation on his
coarse, broad face, which deepened instantly to anger
as his eyes fell upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;They told me you were engaged, Princess, as I
see,&#8221; he said, with a sneer at me; &#8220;but I had a matter
of urgency to discuss with you, so I bade your
servants announce me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your urgency will cost my servants their places,&#8221;
she answered, the expression of her face hardening into
cold austerity&mdash;so different from anything I had seen
during our interview.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not think it could be anything very important,&#8221;
he answered, paying no heed to her words.
&#8220;Who is this gentleman?&#8221; and he turned and glowered
at me.</p>

<p>Not only a bully, but a cad, was my thought, as I
returned his look with generous interest.</p>

<p>The Princess murmured our names formally and
coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard something of you, Count, from General
Kolfort.&#8221; He spoke as if it had been nothing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
my good. &#8220;If I mistake not, I saw you at the ball
last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was there,&#8221; I answered curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want a word or two with you, sometime, and will
wait upon you.&#8221; Had I been a servant at whom he
was flinging an order, he could not have put more
offensive patronage into his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will write your business I will see if I have
time to give you an appointment,&#8221; I answered with
intentional brusqueness. He was not accustomed to
be addressed in such a tone, and he started and flushed
with anger. I took no notice, but with a bow to the
Princess I murmured, &#8220;I have the honour to wish you
good day, Madame,&#8221; and, ignoring the Duke entirely,
I went away, leaving him staring angrily after me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate the brute,&#8221; I said to myself as I went into
the street; and in truth I seemed to find a special
cause of offence in the fact that I had had to leave him
alone with the Princess. &#8220;I wish to Heaven he&#8217;d
quarrel with me,&#8221; I muttered; and, indeed, the wish
was to have a fulfilment that at the moment I had no
cause to anticipate or hope.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>&#8220;IN THE NAME OF A WOMAN&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> result of my interview with the Princess will
be readily understood. It made me more devoted to
her than ever. The sweetness of her manner, the
charm of her rare beauty, the loftiness of her aims, the
faith and confidence she had shown in me, and the
many signs of her reliance upon me had enslaved me.
In a word, I was in love with her. She was far above
me, and there was no hope that I could ever win her
for my wife. There were a thousand obstacles in the
way. But there was nothing to stop my loving her.</p>

<p>So far I had never met one to touch my heart and
kindle the myriad flames of inspiring passion which
throbbed and thrilled in me now with such ecstasy at
the mere thought of this rare and wonderful pearl
among women.</p>

<p>I gave heed to no thought of consequences&mdash;never
paused to think what the end of such a passion might
be, nor where it might lead me. She had changed
every habit of my mind. Usually cautious, calculating,
and self-reserved, I heeded nothing now but the
delicious knowledge that I loved her and could serve
her, and help her to gain the high and noble end she
had in view. And serve her I vowed I would with
every faculty I possessed, and, if the need were, at the
cost of every drop of blood in my body. I flung
every other consideration to the winds and dizzied my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
brain with dreams of the delight it would yield me to
feel that I could be the means of helping her.</p>

<p>That she depended upon me and trusted me was in
itself a delirium of pleasure, and, come what might, I
would never fail nor falter in her service. Others
might have their aims and objects in this wild business
of the intrigue, I would serve Christina, and Christina
only, &#8220;In the Name of a Woman.&#8221; Whatever it
should be to others, to me it had a real and inspiring
meaning, and for me it was destined to be no mere
watchword or formula, but the guiding principle of
every act and thought and the lode star to determine
my life.</p>

<p>But I would guard my secret jealously; it should be
mine and mine only. The fire must burn, but it
should be down in the centre of my heart; and on the
surface no prying eyes should pierce the mask of
reserve with which I would conceal my passion.</p>

<p>All this came to me clearly in the frank self-communing
of the night, and with it a full admission
of the real cause for my hatred of the Duke Sergius.
It was not so much the man himself I detested&mdash;detestable
though I believed him&mdash;but the future husband
of Christina, using and defiling that fair shrine
for the sordid purpose of his selfish policy. He and
those in league with him would use the rarest and
fairest of God&#8217;s women as a tool for their own base
ends. The mere thought of it was an abomination of
desecration.</p>

<p>But they would have to reckon with me, and in my
new love-madness I piled up oath upon oath that I
would spoil their plans and thwart their designs
against her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have unbounded faith in you.&#8221; The words rang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
in my ears like the strain from some angel&#8217;s song, and
filled me with such enthusiasm that I longed for the
moment of action, and could scarce find patience to
wait through the lingering hours of darkness that I
might begin my work; and I lay, my brain simmering
with plots and plans against the two men, Sergius and
Kolfort, who were thus leagued against Christina.</p>

<p>By the morning, however, I was cooler, and in a
fitter frame of mind to face the thousand difficulties
of the position.</p>

<p>Spernow was with me early, and I had my first lesson
in the necessity of keeping my feelings out of sight.
He had heard of my interview with the Princess, and
came eager to learn the result. I knew very well by
this time that that very shrewd little Mademoiselle
Broumoff was at the bottom of his eagerness, and I
was on my guard.</p>

<p>I told him that the Princess had convinced me of
the soundness of her policy, and that I should do all
in my power to help her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she not all I said of her?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a woman with a mission,&#8221; I answered somewhat
coldly. &#8220;But her mission is a high and bright
one in the interests of Bulgaria and freedom, and, as
those are interests in which I feel a deep concern, I
shall give her all the help in my power.&#8221;</p>

<p>The studied deliberateness of my tone perplexed
him, for he looked at me in some surprise and disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all you thought of her, my dear Count?
You must have a cool head&mdash;for you have filled her
with enthusiasm.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was sweet music to me indeed; but I replied
indifferently:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>&#8220;I base my opinions on my judgment;&#8221; and I
smiled as if in deprecation of enthusiasm. &#8220;But now
I have much to do to-day. I take possession of my
house, and I wish to have a consultation with you and
Captain Zoiloff as to certain plans. Will you bring
him to me there at noon? We have to discuss the
future form of our new association.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as he had left me I hurried to meet the officers
of my regiment, and my reception by them was exceedingly
cordial and friendly&mdash;partly due, as I afterwards
learnt, to my duel with Ristich, who had been a
much hated man; and also because of my reputation
as a man of wealth. I gave one prompt proof of this
by asking the whole of my brother officers to dine
with me at an early date.</p>

<p>By noon I was back at my house to meet Zoiloff and
Spernow, and after we had had some practice with the
foils and in pistol shooting we set to work upon the
serious business of the conference.</p>

<p>We arranged that I should be the head of the organisation,
with Zoiloff next in charge under me; and he
threw himself with keen ardour into the work.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you how glad I am to have you with
us in this, Count,&#8221; he said, when we had debated and
settled details. &#8220;Now that you have come, you seem to
be just the man we were waiting for; and this place
of yours will be a magnificent rendezvous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we have many join us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We do not want too many, but all will be carefully
picked, and every man will be one wielding influence
over others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How will General Kolfort view the scheme?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All he will know will be that here is in training a
band of young men all working for the object which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
he desires, and all capable of giving the greatest help
to the movement. The real secret will be in as few
hands as possible. When he knows more it will be too
late for him to interfere,&#8221; he said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be the hour of danger,&#8221; I returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather the hour of triumph. Think what it must
mean in a country like ours to have, say, five hundred
young men in this city, each influencing many more,
drawn from all classes, high and low, all joined by the
strongest ties for one common object, and all looking
upon one man as their leader&mdash;&#8216;In the Name of a
Woman.&#8217; You will wield a tremendous power, Count.
God grant you use it wisely,&#8221; he said, earnestly. &#8220;But
I have no doubt of that. I should not be here if I
had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall wield it only for the one object.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will turn the scale in any crisis,&#8221; said Spernow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will free the country,&#8221; said Zoiloff.</p>

<p>I said nothing, but was thinking of the help it would
render to my Princess.</p>

<p>One thing troubled me. The General had declared
that he would not permit me to remain in the country
unless I pledged myself to join him; and give that
pledge I would not. Neither would I leave the country.
And when my two companions had left, I sat
pondering a way out of the difficulty. There was but
one way that I could see&mdash;to have him satisfied by some
indirect means that I had espoused the cause of the
Princess, and leave him to draw the inference for himself
that in serving her I intended to serve him and
his party also.</p>

<p>In this connection I thought of Spernow. He was
the General&#8217;s agent specially told off to sound me, and
it would be quite possible for him to give a report sufficiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
plausible to effect what was wanted. But who
should coach Spernow? The answer came with the
question. Without doubt it must be Mademoiselle
Broumoff, and it remained only for me to get an interview
with her and tell her what to do.</p>

<p>Inwardly I tried to persuade myself that this might
be a sufficient reason for me to seek another interview
with the Princess; but I put the temptation away from
me, strong as it was, reflecting that any too great
eagerness on my part to see her would only defeat the
very end I had in view&mdash;to be of real help. I must
raise no suspicions anywhere by seeking to see her too
often.</p>

<p>I was thinking this matter out when a servant
brought me the card of the Duke Sergius. I started
as I saw it, and for a moment was inclined to send an
excuse. But reflecting that I must now take my share
in helping to blind his eyes, I went to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not adopted the somewhat roundabout way
you suggested yesterday for having an interview with
you, Count Benderoff, but have come direct to you. I
am accustomed to go straight to a point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; My tone was curt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and I must understand one another a little
better. I have heard of you from General Kolfort,
who seems inclined to take you rather seriously; and I
may say at once that since I saw you yesterday I have
changed my opinion about you. The Princess Christina
spoke to me pretty frankly concerning you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; I said again; I hated to hear him even
speak her name so glibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I looked on you before as a sort of superior spy&mdash;sent
here, probably from England, to see what was
going on. But I now understand that we are to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
friends to work together. I am glad to hear it.&#8221; He
spoke with a sort of blustering bluntness that he may
have intended for an engaging frankness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know that I am much concerned what
opinion you take the trouble to form about me,&#8221; I
answered, coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it all, man, can&#8217;t you see I have come in a
friendly spirit to talk over together the things we have
in common? Why do you receive me like this?&#8221; He
spoke sharply, and, I thought, angrily; and when I did
not answer immediately, he added with a laugh that
had no mirth in it: &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose I am in the
habit of hawking round my friendship?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I suggested anything of the kind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make it very difficult for me to enter into
things with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen you twice, sir,&#8221; I answered deliberately.
&#8220;The first time at the ball the other evening, when you
were good enough to scowl at me, and yesterday at the
Princess Christina&#8217;s house, when your words were a
kind of scowl expressed audibly. We Englishmen are
not accustomed to read such actions as the preliminaries
of a friendship.&#8221;</p>

<p>He started at the word Englishmen, and his eyes
lighted with swift anger. Obviously he hated everything
English; nor did I wish him to make an exception
in my case. I think he read as much in my eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You Englishmen take very queer views of many
things,&#8221; he answered, after a short pause. &#8220;But I
thought you were more a Roumanian, and thus a friend
of my country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the honour to be a Roumanian Count,&#8221; I
said, tersely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish to quarrel with me, Count Benderoff?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
But before I could reply, he added: &#8220;But there, that
must be ridiculous, for the Princess tells me I may look
upon you as a man devoted to her cause, and, therefore,
to mine. I shall not be unmindful of those who
help us, I would have you understand that&mdash;though I
wish you did not make it so difficult for me to tell
it you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not working for any hope of material reward
at your hands,&#8221; I answered equivocally. His patronising
tone galled me.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter. That will not prevent your accepting it
when the time comes. Few men do that, I find&mdash;even
Englishmen. But now I wish us to be friends and
comrades, Count. Do you see any reason against it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have not begun auspiciously,&#8221; said I drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it!&#8221; he cried with an oath. &#8220;You are as
diffident as a girl in her teens. I don&#8217;t find men inclined
to quarrel with my offers of friendship, I can tell
you. I am not without power and influence, I can
assure you;&#8221; and he smiled boastfully.</p>

<p>I made no response to his offer. I could not.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have made a good choice of a house, Count,&#8221; he
said, after another pause. &#8220;I congratulate you. And
where is the room where you are going to lure the coy
pigeons to be trained in the service of the Princess
Christina?&#8221; Evidently she had told him of the project.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will show it you, if you like,&#8221; I said, rising.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing will please me better,&#8221; he said, following
me from the room. &#8220;Egad, a splendid hall!&#8221; he exclaimed
in genuine admiration as we entered it. &#8220;Men
tell me, too, that you know how to use the sword well.
From all accounts you easily spitted that fool Ristich
the first time at old Kolfort&#8217;s, and did just what
you liked with him when you met him on the ground.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;He was wounded, and in my opinion unfit to fight.
I protested against his doing so, as you may have
heard; but he insisted, and left me no option.&#8221;</p>

<p>He examined all the arrangements and gymnastic
apparatus with obvious interest, making many comments
to show his appreciation of everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a novel thing for Sofia,&#8221; he said, after a
while. &#8220;And a devilish shrewd device to draw in the
young bloods of the place. They will make a hero of
you, Count. A splendid thought, and one that shows
what an acquisition you will be to us. A pistol range,
too; magnificent! May I try a shot or two?&#8221; He
spoke with assumed indifference, but I caught a glance
which told me he wished to surprise me with a display
of his skill in shooting.</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; I answered readily, not at all unwilling
to see what he could do, and to show him also
that I knew how to handle a pistol pretty well.</p>

<p>He was a good shot, and took a pride in his work,
laughing boastfully when he sent his bullet three times
in succession into the bull&#8217;s-eye of the small target.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m strange to the pistol, of course; but that&#8217;s not
bad for a first attempt, eh? I&#8217;m a bit out of practice,
too, for I haven&#8217;t a place like this to keep my hand in.&#8221;
There was a sneer at me in this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to the further mark,&#8221; I said, putting him half
a dozen paces to the rear. &#8220;You shoot well.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried from the further mark and hit the target
each time, but only once got on to the bull&#8217;s-eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long distance, and the light&#8217;s rather bad. Do
you shoot much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a little. I have only had two or three shots
here;&#8221; and I picked up a revolver carelessly. &#8220;I am
sorry you found the light bad.&#8221; I turned, then levelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
the pistol and fired half-a-dozen shots in rapid succession.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have missed,&#8221; he cried, laughing gleefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not. You will find the six bullets in a ring
round the bull&#8217;s-eye. I never miss.&#8221; I spoke with intentionally
boastful swagger.</p>

<p>He went up to the target and examined it, and then
turned to me:</p>

<p>&#8220;By the Lord, you&#8217;re a wonderful shot. Where did
you learn that trick?&#8221;</p>

<p>The unfeigned surprise and admiration in his tone
pleased me. He would know now, at least, that I was
not a man to be trifled with; from that moment his
manner towards me changed, and his bluster and
swagger decreased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very fond of pistol practice,&#8221; I answered
quietly.</p>

<p>He went up to the target again and stood before it,
scrutinising the marks of the bullets as though I had
performed a miracle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw anything like it. It&#8217;s wonderful,&#8221; I
heard him mutter to himself. Then in a louder tone
to me: &#8220;I should like to come here for practice,
Count.&#8221; But I had no mind for that.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would not do, I am afraid. If we are to make
this business a success, I must be as slightly associated
with you as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is true&mdash;and shrewd enough. You won&#8217;t
want recruits if you can teach them to do that,&#8221;
pointing to the target. &#8220;And are you equally clever
with the foils?&#8221; I could have found it in me to laugh
at the change in his manner. He was like a man who
had come to bully and had unexpectedly been whipped.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, a long way from it. Would you like to try?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
But he declined on the plea that he had no time. His
refusal surprised me, for I had heard that he was a
splendid fencer, and was somewhat curious to see how
far he was my superior. I concluded that he was unwilling
to show me how really skilful he was, and had
to content myself with the evident impression my skill
with the revolver had produced.</p>

<p>He left me soon afterwards, expressing another hope
that we should be friends; but I was as guarded in my
reply as I had been before, and certainly no more cordial.</p>

<p>I was glad of the visit, however. He had solved the
difficulty which had been perplexing me. It was evident
that the Princess had said enough to lead
him to think that I was working on his side, and I
was convinced that he would say as much to General
Kolfort, and thus unwittingly render me a service.</p>

<p>That our dislike was mutual I had no doubt. He
had come resolved to patronise and, perhaps, to ride
rough shod over me in his swaggering, overbearing
way; and his performance with the pistol had been
intended to intimidate me, by proving that he was as
dangerous to quarrel with as he was powerful as an
ally. But my display had changed all that; and in a
degree had humiliated him in my eyes at the very
moment when he was keen to appear most formidable.</p>

<p>He was a man to take such a rebuff badly; and for
the future I felt he would be no friend of mine.
Whether he would dare to be an enemy depended
upon his skill as a swordsman; and that he had carefully
kept hidden from me.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he had cleared one tangle from the
skein of my difficulties, and I was therefore glad of the
visit. Whether he would seek to show his enmity
openly I did not trouble to ask myself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>BETRAYED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next few days were crowded ones for me. The
organisation of our conspirators went forward with
astonishing success&mdash;the fruit, of course, of the previous
efforts of Zoiloff and those working with him; and
when we held our first big meeting to inaugurate our
new &#8220;Club,&#8221; we had nearly three hundred splendid
young fellows zealous to pledge themselves to the
finger-tips in the cause of the Princess Christina.</p>

<p>Each of them had been presented privately to me,
and each promised unreservedly to follow my leadership.
All were animated by the most patriotic enthusiasm,
and many of them were in a position to influence
considerable numbers of their compatriots.</p>

<p>The scheme of the Gymnasium Club evoked great
praise, and I was surprised by the ardour with which
they threw themselves into the task of athletic training.
All the details of this were managed by Zoiloff
and a few carefully chosen men under him; and after
the first meeting these leaders supped with me, and
many were the exuberant anticipations of success that
found expression. Zoiloff himself threw aside his
customary reserve, and led on the rest to praise me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the finest movement ever started in Bulgaria,
Count,&#8221; he said to me when Spernow and he and I
were alone. &#8220;And it will spread like a heath on fire,
from here to every town and centre in the country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
In a month we shall have such power and influence as
never before was wielded by anyone here;&#8221; and Spernow
was equally enthusiastic.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am astonished, I think, by what I have seen to-night,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you don&#8217;t know my countrymen,&#8221; exclaimed
Zoiloff, whose eyes shone and sparkled with the fire of
feeling. &#8220;They have been crushed under the curse of
the Crescent; they have groaned under the oppression
till the fire of patriotism has flickered low indeed, for
there seemed no gleam of hope; they have suffered,
God alone knows how bitterly and drearily, till the
iron was like to enter their souls and corrode every
generous instinct and fervour; but, thanks be to God,
those instincts are not dead, and we shall rouse them
into an activity that will startle Europe and save the
Balkan States. We have done much in the past few
years, as you know; but that is nothing to what we
shall yet achieve. Were the Prince other than he is,
the hand of Russia weighing less heavily on him, and
their dastardly work of suborning and sapping the
truth and honour of the prominent men of the country
less deadly, we should not now be cowering and
cringing under the talons of the Eagles. Think what
it has been to work always under leaders whom we
doubted and distrusted for traitors. But that is
changed at last. We will have no more of the old
leaders. It is the age of young men; and, by the God
that made us all, we&#8217;ll never stay nor falter now till the
glorious end is reached.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Spernow, in a rousing tone of concentrated
earnestness. &#8220;Good, and true, every word
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No looking back, that is the spirit I honour!&#8221; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
exclaimed, infected by their enthusiasm, and thinking
of the Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;A toast!&#8221; cried Zoiloff, jumping to his feet, his
eyes flashing, and his rough, rugged features aglow, as
he raised his glass on high. &#8220;May the hand that holds
this glass blight and rot if it ever falters or turns from
the righteous cause&mdash;In the Name of a Woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amen to that,&#8221; said I earnestly, as Spernow and
I repeated his words, and finished solemnly together&mdash;&#8220;In
the Name of a Woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never dared before to be enthusiastic, but
you have inspired me, Count. We have a leader in
you who will carry us far, and whom all will come to
trust as I do;&#8221; and Zoiloff gave me his hand, holding
mine in a grip that trembled under his excitement.</p>

<p>There was, however, a source of danger that these
two knew nothing of, and I could not tell them&mdash;the
fear of the Countess Bokara&#8217;s violence.</p>

<p>For the few days I had succeeded in evading her I
calculated that she would attempt nothing by herself,
but would endeavour first to use me for the work. She
had said as much when I had seen her in the presence
of the Prince; and it was, of course, obvious that if
she could secure my aid her task would be vastly
easier. I had the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to the Princess Christina&#8217;s
house, as she knew, and could thus, were I so minded,
render her just the kind of assistance she needed. But
I knew she would act soon.</p>

<p>My anxiety on the score of General Kolfort&#8217;s intention
to get me out of his way had been removed as
the result of the visit of Duke Sergius coupled with
what the General had heard from Spernow, and probably
from the Princess herself. He did not send for
me and I did not seek him, but on the morning following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
the meeting at my house he put himself in my
way as I was returning from my military duties.</p>

<p>We were both on horseback, and I was passing him
with a salute, when he reined up his horse and
stopped me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not come to me, Count,&#8221; he said curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And do not propose to come, General,&#8221; I answered
in a similar tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not wrong in my estimate of you, I find.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not recall it for the moment,&#8221; said I indifferently.</p>

<p>He looked at me and smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. A little open antagonism to me is your
shrewdest course. I understand you. You are what
I thought&mdash;a very clever young man. And you can
assure everyone that you are not pledged to me&mdash;openly.
I understand you, I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a well-known judge of men your opinion is
flattering, General,&#8221; I answered ambiguously.</p>

<p>His smile broadened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very non-committal, as usual. And yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And
here his smile vanished, and his eyes took an expression
of deep penetration. &#8220;Be careful that your
cleverness and ambition don&#8217;t carry you too far. If
that time should come and I have to act, remember
that I warned you. I know what you are doing, and
am watching you carefully.&#8221; Then in a lighter tone he
added: &#8220;I am glad to hear such good accounts of your
military work, and glad, too, that I have not to compel
you to leave a country that has such sore need of the
valuable services which a man like you can render it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with a salute he passed on, leaving me to digest
the irony and hidden meaning of his last words. I
rode on thoughtfully to my house. The impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
he left on my mind was perhaps just such as he had
designed&mdash;that the attempt to trick him was indeed
like playing with fire on the top of a powder magazine.
And I was profoundly uneasy as I thought of what
that might mean to the woman whose safety and success
were now infinitely more to me than my own.</p>

<p>At my house a surprise was in store for me. A carriage
was at the door, and the servants told me that a
lady was awaiting me.</p>

<p>I went to the room at once and found the Countess
Bokara. She rose with a smile as she held out her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look magnificent in your regimentals, Count.
And I suppose you have been too busy with your new
duties and new friends to think it worth while to see
me. And you don&#8217;t seem over-pleased that I am here
now,&#8221; she added, for my face clouded at the sight of
her. She was a bird of ill-omen, as I knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your object in honouring me with this
informal visit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Informal! Where is the need of formality between
you and me?&#8221; she asked quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Sofia the tongues of gossip run glibly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have soon developed into an authority on the
manners of the people here. Spare me your cant, I
beg of you. What do you suppose I should care if all
the old gossips in the city talked me over till their
tongues ached? You ask why I am here. I wish to see
you, that is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at your service,&#8221; I answered, with a bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you? That&#8217;s just what I wish to know,&#8221; she
replied, putting a significant meaning to my conventional
phrase. &#8220;You have not given much evidence of
it as yet. I should rather think you have even forgotten
your promise to serve me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>&#8220;I am, at any rate, ready to listen to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me piercingly during a rather long
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began, but checked herself
abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your thoughts are always shrewd,&#8221; I returned.</p>

<p>At the reply she looked up and laughed, with such
an expression of malignity that it made her face hateful,
for all the beauty of her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little know how shrewd this time, Count Benderoff,
or you would drop that insipid conventionality,
I promise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are pleased to speak in riddles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, because you act them,&#8221; she retorted, almost
fiercely. &#8220;But I promise to be plain enough before I
leave you. I will drop the one if you will drop the
other&mdash;but, there, you&#8217;ll have to, as you&#8217;ll soon see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not pretend to understand you,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll try to make you. You are not
generally dull. Tell me plainly, if you can, on what
side are you in all these matters? The question is
merely to give you a chance of being frank with me,
for I know much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I seek the same object as yourself&mdash;the freedom of
Bulgaria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye. In the Name of a Woman, you mean? You
think I do not know your canting phrase.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was on my guard now, and did not let her see my
surprise at her words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the honour to bear a commission in the
Prince&#8217;s own regiment, as you know,&#8221; I answered
evasively.</p>

<p>&#8220;The commission I got for you. Of course I know.
But what do you mean by that empty answer? Are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
you for or against me? For Heaven&#8217;s sake try to speak
frankly! Nothing else will serve either you or me in
this.&#8221; And she stamped her foot with a gesture of
impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as our aims are in common, I am with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think an answer like that will satisfy me?
I am beginning to understand you; and if my reading
is right, you and those with you may well take heed
for yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have come to threaten me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I began,
when she broke in:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not come to threaten. I have come to have
a clear understanding; that is all. And I will have it,&#8221;
she said, impetuously. &#8220;I will give you another chance.
What did the Prince say to you when you were with
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know there was anything&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the love of Heaven, man, drop this conventional
cant and speak as plainly as you can if you wish. What
did he say to you about this mad intention of his to
abdicate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Intention to abdicate?&#8221; I echoed, as if taken by
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which means that he did tell you, and you would
now pretend that he did not.&#8221; And, yielding to a
sudden storm of passion, she broke out into a torrent
of indignant reproaches of what she termed my breach
of trust in not telling her.</p>

<p>I did not interrupt her, and gathered that she had
only just heard from the Prince what he had said to
me. I understood now the cause of her visit and the
reason of her passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;As his Highness told me in confidence, I could
not betray it,&#8221; I said as soon as I could get a word in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
&#8220;He no doubt told you that he laid a charge of
secrecy upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you did nothing to dissuade him, nothing to
stop him from a madly suicidal step. You, who pretend
to pose as a disinterested friend of Bulgaria devoted
to him and to me! And do you think, knowing
me as you do, for all your flippant lip-service to the
jargon of conventionality, that I will let this thing be?
Do you think that I am so powerless a fool that I cannot
stop it? Oh, I am a mad woman when I think of it!&#8221;
she cried desperately. &#8220;It can be stopped and must
be&mdash;do you hear? must; and you must help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot see how I can help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had risen from her chair and was pacing the
room in her anger and now came close to me, and in a
tone of concentrated energy and fierceness said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The death of that woman Christina will stop it;
and in that you can help, aye, and you shall help me.&#8221;
Her face was ablaze with rage and hate as she uttered
the Princess&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince himself is opposed to any more bloodshed,&#8221;
I said bluntly. &#8220;The sentiment does him infinite
honour, and I share it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dare to say that to me? To set me at defiance?
To go back upon the pledge you gave? Are
you a coward, Count Benderoff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be no party to the assassination of the
Princess,&#8221; I answered sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You defy me?&#8221; And, laying her hand on my arm,
she stared into my eyes for some moments in silence,
and then, her lips curling and her face so hard and set
that the nostrils dilated with the vehemence of her
anger, she added: &#8220;I could kill you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearly it was to be open war between us, and I prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
for it. I drew my arm away and answered
coldly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, Madam, this interview has lasted long
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started as if I had insulted her, and I looked for
another passionate outbreak. But it did not come.
Instead of that her expression underwent a complete
change and she laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor fool!&#8221; she cried in a bantering tone. &#8220;Do
you know where I shall go straight from here if you
turn me away? Wait a moment and I will tell you.&#8221;
She paused, paying no heed to my gesture of anger.
&#8220;In the Name of a Woman, eh? This excellent house,
this sumptuous display of wealth, this clever, shrewd
Englishman, with his hatred of plots, this attractive
idea of a gymnasium club&mdash;what does it all mean?&#8221;
And she leered at me with a look infinitely cunning.</p>

<p>I kept my face quite impassive as I met her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like to tell me the inner secret, or
shall I tell you? I know&mdash;I know everything.&#8221; She
paused again, but I gave no sign; and then the rage
began to return to her face, and her tone grew
vehement again. &#8220;It is a lie&mdash;and a lie against the
man whose eyes I can open with a word. You are
working and plotting for the Princess, In the Name of
a Woman, are you not? And these Russian fools and
dolts think you are working for them at the same
time. But I know your real intent. To fool them up
to the moment when you can throw off the disguise&mdash;to
put this precious Princess on the throne, and then
to snap your fingers in the face of the old dotard, Kolfort,
and obey only the Princess. This marriage, on
which he counts so much, is never to take place; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
when you have rallied and organised these members of
your club, as you call it, you reckon you will be strong
enough to throw over the Russians and declare for
what you call Bulgarian independence. Independence,
forsooth, with such a woman as Christina on the
throne.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew now the extent of the sudden peril, but I
thrust the fear that filled my soul for Christina&#8217;s sake
out of sight and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a lively imagination, Madam!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; turn it aside with a scoff or a sneer if you
think you can. But do you believe General Kolfort
will think it nothing more than the subject of a sneer
when he learns it?&#8221; She was disappointed that I
showed no sign of fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can take your own course, and if you think to
help yourself or the Prince by filling the air with your
fables, do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a coward, Count Benderoff,&#8221; she cried
hotly, &#8220;to play thus on my helplessness. I know that
I cannot help my Prince or strengthen his position by
telling what I know, and what you dare not deny, to
be true. But if I cannot help my cause, I can at least
revenge myself, and I will. A word from me and
where will be all your plots and plotters? Your club
will exercise then in the yards of the gaols and
behind the walls of Tirnova fortress. I tell you, you
dare not play me false.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew the grip she had on me now could tighten in
a moment into strangulation, with the ruin of every
man and woman among us; but I maintained my impassive,
stern expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you choose to spread these tales, I cannot stay
you,&#8221; I answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>&#8220;Will you help me to my revenge upon the woman
Christina?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by revenge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Death,&#8221; she cried fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would slay you with my own hand first,&#8221; I answered,
the passion in me rushing to utterance.</p>

<p>She laughed again vindictively and hatefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is true, then, she has bewitched you. I might
have known it. I told you and warned you that she
was a vampire using up men&#8217;s lives with the unpitying
remorselessness of a wild beast. And you are her
latest lover, I suppose!&#8221;</p>

<p>The slander suggested by her words maddened me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hear no more, Madam,&#8221; I said sternly.</p>

<p>She threw up her head with a gesture of pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you order me to leave your house&mdash;knowing
the consequences?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was in sore perplexity. She was a devil and she
looked it as she stared at me, her lovely eyes glowing
with rage and hate and menace.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have more to say it must be at another time,
when you are in a different mood,&#8221; I returned.</p>

<p>She seemed about to burst forth again in her wild,
vehement way, but as suddenly changed her mood and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand. You wish to find a bridge over as
dangerous a chasm as a man ever yet had to cross. I
will see you again; but next time it will be to hear
from you that you accept my terms. You are not a
man to walk open-eyed to sheer ruin. I will go.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as she left me, sweeping out of the room, with
a challenging, defiant, triumphant smile, I could
almost have found it in me to kill her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>THE SPY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as the door closed behind the Countess
Bokara, I threw myself into a chair in a condition of
unspeakable dismay, rage, and chagrin at this most
unexpected turn.</p>

<p>It spelt ruin to everything and everybody concerned
in our scheme. I had seen and heard quite enough of
General Kolfort to know full well that the merest hint
of such a plot as ours would drive him instantly to
desperate extremes. He would put in force every
engine of the powerful machinery at his instant disposal
to crush and punish us. And that he could
crush us as easily as he would pinch a fly between his
fingers there was not a doubt. His power was practically
absolute, and he would use it mercilessly, like the
man of iron that he was.</p>

<p>Nor was that the worst. There was a traitor somewhere
in our midst; a recreant who had carried the
secret in hot haste to this vengeful woman. I could
not hazard even a guess as to whose was the treachery,
but that it threatened the future of the scheme, should
even she herself be silenced, was as patent as the fingers
on one&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>Yet what to do I could not see, plague and rack my
wits as I would, as I sat alternating between moods of
consternation, rage, and searching reflection.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I had a horse saddled and rode out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
of the town for a gallop in the country, in the hope
that some solution of the problem would suggest
itself; and the ride cooled and sobered me.</p>

<p>Two things were imperative. We must find the
leakage and blind the traitor as to our real intentions.
Our future safety rested on that being done without
delay; and for this purpose I must see Zoiloff and
consult with him. As soon as we discovered the Judas
among us we could take measures to deal with him.
If possible, that should be done by cunning; but, failing
that, averse as I was to bloodshed and violence,
force must be used. But an idea occurred to me by
which he could be effectively hoodwinked, and I stored
it by for use should the occasion come.</p>

<p>As to the Countess Bokara, there were two courses.
One was for me to appear to play into her hands and
so gain time for our own plans to ripen&mdash;a line of action
vastly repulsive to me, with all its necessary paraphernalia
of deceit and lies; the other, to kidnap her and
put her into safe keeping until the crisis should be
passed. I knew that I could lure her to my house, and
that then the necessary measures could be taken; but
the cowardice of the plan made me entertain it only
with disgust.</p>

<p>In the case of a man I would not have hesitated for
a moment; indeed I would never have let him leave
the house that day. But with a woman I could scarcely
bear the thought of it, although this woman was vastly
more dangerous than many men.</p>

<p>I sought keenly for some other scheme, and for a
moment entertained the idea of going to the Prince
himself, telling him all frankly, and begging his aid to
deal with her. But I abandoned it. I remembered he
had said he would stand by the throne if he could make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
sure of efficient help, and I calculated that his vacillation
would cause him to turn now and claim the help
of our party in his defence. A worse than useless
effort, as I knew, owing to the impossibility of rallying
to his cause the men who had been turned from him
by his weakness. Not only could we do no good for
him, but we should imperil the great patriotic rising for
no purpose.</p>

<p>I was therefore driven back upon the distasteful
course of duping the woman who had thus threatened
us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would to heaven she were a man!&#8221; And each
time the thought broke from me in involuntary utterance,
I pictured how easy it would then be to act.</p>

<p>As I was riding back, moody and thoughtful, I met
the carriage of the Princess. She caught sight of me
when I was still at a distance, and her lovely face was
wreathed with a radiant smile as she checked her horses
and greeted me. Mademoiselle Broumoff was by her
side, and her keen, sharp eyes were quick to read
trouble in my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look very thoughtful, Count,&#8221; said the Princess,
&#8220;as if heavy military affairs were weighing upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been thinking out the answer to a very ingenious
problem set me this morning,&#8221; I said, trying
to speak lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been a trying problem for your horse, I
should think,&#8221; she said, glancing at his flanks, which
were covered with foam, for I had ridden hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not more so than for his rider, I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it has not distressed you as much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count carries the sign of that in his face,&#8221;
said the little Broumoff, earnestly. &#8220;I hope it is no
more than a military problem.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;All problems in Bulgaria have their military side,&#8221;
I answered gravely.</p>

<p>The Princess&#8217;s eyes showed concern. She understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not let your horse stand while he is so
heated with his problem, Count. If you would like
to see me, I shall be at home in an hour from
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With your permission, I will call,&#8221; I said, and
saluted her as she drove on. &#8220;I will have the searchlight
of her woman&#8217;s wit on the matter,&#8221; was my
thought as I rode home; and, despite the grave and
critical reason for the interview, I was yet half disposed
to be glad of it, so much store did I set on the opportunity
of being in her presence. I could scarcely wait
with patience for the minutes to run out until I could
start for her house.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Broumoff was still with her when I
arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have news of some kind for me, Count?&#8221; said
the Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, I bring you bad news, Madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It could not come by a more unwilling messenger,
I am sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On my honour, that is true,&#8221; I said earnestly,
touched by her gentle thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;And half its sting will be blunted since I hear it
from you. What is it? Tell me frankly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Its sting cannot but be sharp enough to wound.
I fear we have a traitor somewhere high up in our
ranks;&#8221; and with that I told her what had passed
in my interview with the Countess Bokara.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is ugly news indeed,&#8221; she said at the close, profoundly
moved. &#8220;And as dangerous as it is ugly.
What think you of it, Nathalie?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Mademoiselle Broumoff had turned pale with sudden
consternation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot think. It is too dreadful. What does the
Count propose?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess turned eagerly to me for my counsel.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must either blind the Countess Bokara or get
her away to a place of safety until we have had some
time to act. But the leakage must be traced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can it be, Nathalie?&#8221; cried the Princess, in a
tone of dismay. &#8220;Have you tried to cure this mad
woman of her prejudice against me, Count?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had as yet no opportunity. Since my first
meeting with her, I have seen her only once for a few
minutes in the presence of the Prince until this morning,
when she came to confound me with this news,
and to urge me to join her in assassinating you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She chose her companion curiously,&#8221; said the Princess,
with a smile of confidence that went straight to
my heart. &#8220;I hope my safety may never be in less
trusty hands than yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not trust myself to answer with more than a
look, and as I turned my eyes away I caught the little
Broumoff eying us keenly. Then the Princess startled
us both.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have made up my mind; I will see her,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christina, it is impossible!&#8221; cried Mademoiselle
Broumoff quickly. &#8220;She would murder you with her
own hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count will guard against that at least, and he
will arrange the interview. Will you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would do much to serve you, but this would be
a hazardous step, and one that can scarcely lead to any
good. You can have but the faintest idea of her
hatred of you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;Then I can learn it for myself. I will see her;&#8221;
and her tone was decision itself. I continued my
attempt to dissuade, but without success, and she
would not rest until I had agreed to arrange a meeting
at my house. One stipulation I insisted upon&mdash;that
I should be present.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should wish that,&#8221; she assented. &#8220;I do not
mean to run any risks, and I should feel safe only if
you were there, Count.&#8221; The words were sweet
enough to my ears, but they did not allay my alarm
on the score of the interview. I yielded all against
my judgment, and arranged to try to get the Countess
Bokara to my house on the following afternoon.</p>

<p>When that was settled I lingered on, inventing pretext
upon pretext for my stay that I might steep my
senses in the charm of her presence, the light of her
eyes, and the music of her voice. Nor did she seem
unwilling for me to stay, as I noticed with rare delight.</p>

<p>But under all the pleasure of this fascinating dalliance
a current of earnest thought was running in my
head, and when I left her I had already formed a plan,
for which I proceeded at once to make preparations.</p>

<p>I had no hope that the Princess would reap any
benefit from the coming interview, for I could not see
a possibility of any good resulting. But I resolved
that if she failed I would have my own plan in readiness.
If the Countess Bokara came to the house, she
should not leave it again except to pass into some place
of security until our plans were complete.</p>

<p>I sent at once in quest of Zoiloff, therefore, and,
having explained everything that had happened, outlined
my scheme.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure that she really knew, and was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
merely making a shrewd guess?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I cannot
think of any man among us who would turn blabber.
But if I find him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He left the sentence unfinished,
but the threat was the more expressive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, there are twenty ways of dealing with a
man,&#8221; said I; &#8220;but a woman is different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A traitor is a traitor, never mind the sex; and I
see no cause for mercy for one more than another,&#8221; he
growled into his beard, his look very set and stern.
&#8220;But what is your plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That we prepare a couple of rooms here in my
house, and keep her until we can find some other place
equally safe and secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this secret? Are you sure of your servants?
May we not look for the leakage among them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spernow found them for me,&#8221; was my answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you change them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every man and woman to-morrow, if you can fill
their places.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do that,&#8221; he assented quickly. &#8220;Wait&mdash;better&mdash;can
you let me see them all? I may spot the
traitor, or at all events separate the sheep from the
goats.&#8221;</p>

<p>I rang the bell and sent for my steward. When he
came I told him to get the servants all together, and
send them in to me one at a time, as I wished to question
them separately about a certain paper which I said
had been mislaid.</p>

<p>They came in one by one, and we so arranged the
position that each stood in a strong light for Zoiloff to
be able to watch them as I put a short string of questions.
He put a black mark against three whom he regarded
as suspicious. The rest, he declared, were above
question.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>&#8220;My opinion is that one of those three men is false
and a spy, presumably in the service of this woman. I
expect they have been eavesdropping when you and I
and Spernow have been together, and perhaps have
caught some unguarded words. The thing is very
ugly. What shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fool them with their own tactics,&#8221; said I readily,
thinking of my original idea. &#8220;Let us have a hurried
meeting of men whom we can trust, have it to-night,
explain the position hurriedly, and pretend that we
are disclosing to them the real object of the plot&mdash;to
work nominally for the Princess, but really for the
Russian party&mdash;and have these suspects so placed that
they can hear what is going on. Then catch them in
the very act; and send them packing with this new
version of the thing in their minds, after a pretty good
fright, and under oath not to reveal the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it will serve; but it will want adroit management,&#8221;
said Zoiloff.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say my steward is a man to be trusted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely. I know him well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Then leave that part to me, while you
hurry off and bring in about a dozen of our men. Let
their arrival be a little dramatic, to give colour to the
drama, so that the spies may think the meeting too
important to be missed; and I will answer for the
rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone I called my steward and
told him plainly that there was a spy in the house, and
that we suspected one of the three men I named.
Then I outlined the arrangements he was to make&mdash;to
get as many of the other servants out of the house
as he could without creating suspicion, and to give
those who remained work to do in other parts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
house, so that the three should be free to spy upon us;
that then he should set them separately some light
kind of work close to the room in which I directed the
meeting was to be held, of which he was to drop a
hint. He was a shrewd fellow, and entered readily
into the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of them is no traitor, sir,&#8221; he said, naming
him. &#8220;I can answer for him with my life. I have
known him for many years, and I am sure of him.
The others I do not know and do not like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, test all three; and as the clock
strikes eleven be at hand to watch them and await my
orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went at once to do as I ordered; and that he
did the work shrewdly the sequel showed.</p>

<p>Zoiloff returned very soon with Spernow and another
man, and I received them in the room which had been
prepared as the stage for our little drama. When the
others came, I noticed with a smile that each was
cloaked; and in all we made a party of fourteen. We
smoked and had wine until I calculated that the spies
would be at their posts; and then, speaking in a tone
lowered but sufficiently distinct to reach any eaves-dropper,
I told them that the hour had come when we
thought it necessary to make a most important disclosure
of our plans. While working apparently for
the Princess, we were, in fact, Russian agents pledged
to the Czar, and bent upon putting the Princess upon
the throne solely in his Majesty&#8217;s interests; and I went
on to declare that the hour had come to strike the
blow, and so on.</p>

<p>A discussion followed, in which objections were
raised and answered, while I kept my eye upon the
clock until the hand was approaching the hour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
eleven, when I rose and declared that this was the
moment when each man must declare himself.</p>

<p>My rising was, in fact, an agreed signal, and Zoiloff,
Spernow, and another man stole noiselessly to the spots
where I knew any listeners would be sure to post
themselves.</p>

<p>As the clock was on the point of striking, the two
doors and a window opening to a conservatory beyond
were flung open, and one of the spies was caught in
the very act of eavesdropping.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are betrayed, Count,&#8221; cried Zoiloff in a voice
of thunder, dragging in the man, who, shivering and
white with fear, wriggled and struggled to free himself
from his stern-faced captor.</p>

<p>A solemn hush fell on the room, while the trembling,
panic-stricken wretch was placed in the midst of
the men who closed round him. The silence was grim
enough to have tried stronger nerves than his.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the meaning of this?&#8221; I asked sternly,
breaking the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not listening, my lord; indeed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lie to me. What did you hear? Quick,
speak the truth, for your life hangs on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard nothing, I swear I did not. I was
only&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; I thundered, &#8220;if you have nothing but
lies to tell.&#8221; He threw himself at my feet and begged
for mercy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak the truth, then,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>He glanced all round the ring of stern, hard-set faces
and threw up his hands, and then clasped them before
his face in despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, you have seen for yourselves; what
say you?&#8221; I asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>&#8220;There is but one punishment for such an act&mdash;death!&#8221;
cried Zoiloff, in such a ringing, merciless tone
that the rascal&#8217;s heart may well have sunk within him.
&#8220;Death, if he will not speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Death, if he will not speak,&#8221; echoed the rest.</p>

<p>At this Zoiloff drew his sword, and at the clash of
the steel in the dead silence the wretch moaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you speak, or die?&#8221; I said, after a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard only a little,&#8221; said the man after a struggle,
his lips so dry and parched that he could only
speak with an effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell it!&#8221; I thundered again; and word by word
he told us that he heard me declare that we were
Russian agents, and all that followed.</p>

<p>His fear of the death that he believed imminent was
sickening to behold, and made me anxious to close the
scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have heard this wretch&#8217;s confession, gentlemen;
what say you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must die!&#8221; cried Zoiloff. &#8220;In the name of
the Czar I claim his life. Every Russian interest in
the country is in peril while he lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will vote, if you please,&#8221; I said. And we
went through a form of writing each man&#8217;s decision on
paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;The verdict is unanimous,&#8221; I said, glancing at the
paper. &#8220;You must die. I would have spared your
life, but I am powerless against all present.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that he clung to me, clutching at my hands and
at my coat, praying, beseeching, imploring, and vowing
that he would never say a word of what he had overheard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose spy are you?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in the service of the Countess Bokara.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;Wait;&#8221; and I left the room, wishing to confer with
my steward as to the other two suspects. The steward
assured me that he had found them just where they
had been directed to remain. I went back to the
room, and the wretch broke out again with cries and
wailings and prayers.</p>

<p>I could bear no more of it, and put an end to the
scene at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I have heard some strange reports with
regard to this man. We will, with your leave, postpone
his punishment, and I will be answerable for his
safe custody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deal with him as you will, Count,&#8221; said Zoiloff.
Calling in the steward, I gave the man into his keeping,
and they left the room together.</p>

<p>The meeting broke up soon after; and Zoiloff remained
only a minute to exchange congratulations
upon the success of the ruse.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have the spy, and to-morrow we will deal with
his employer;&#8221; and his look was as black as a thunder-cloud
as he spoke.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>FACE TO FACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after Zoiloff had left me I sent for the spy. It
was part of the scheme that he should be liberated at
once, in order that, if he pleased, he should carry the
news that he had heard to his employer.</p>

<p>The interview was short. I told him I had determined
to spare his life and set him free if he would
take a solemn vow never to reveal what he had heard,
and to leave the country at once. There was no mistaking
the genuineness of his terror, and he was eager
to take any oath I wished to impose. As I dismissed
him I said, with all the sternness I could concentrate
into my voice and looks:</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember that from this hour you are a marked
man. Every Russian agent in this country will know
you; your every action will be watched, and every
word you speak will be noted. One breath of treachery,
one single suggestion of further deceit, and you
are a dead man. Your life hangs on the thinnest of
threads. And if ever you feel tempted to break your
oath, recall this night and the stern faces of the ring
of men who voted that you should die. Go!&#8221;</p>

<p>He staggered out of the room, reeling like a broken-witted
drunkard.</p>

<p>After my regimental work on the following day
Zoiloff came to me, looking worn and wearied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>&#8220;I have been at work all night,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but I
have done good. I have found a place where this
woman, Bokara, can be held in absolute safety for ten
years if necessary, if once we can get her there.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he told me that one of our party, named
Kroubi, had a large house in the middle of his estate,
in a tower of which just such a prison as we sought
could be found.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure of the man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As of myself. And he himself will be her keeper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a woman of rare fascination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would she fascinate me, think you?&#8221; he asked, a
smile on his rugged face.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are not many men like you, Zoiloff,&#8221; said I,
warmly, for during our intercourse he had won upon
me strangely. He was such a staunch, genuine,
thorough fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is pleasant hearing from you,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;But you need have no fear on Kroubi&#8217;s account.
Every impulse of his strong character which is not
devoted to our cause is absorbed by his hatred of
women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will trust him, then,&#8221; I agreed. &#8220;And now
let us consider how to get her to his place.&#8221; And
when we had threshed this out and made our plans the
time for the Countess Bokara&#8217;s visit was close.</p>

<p>I felt both anxious and excited. The whole future
of our plans hung, as I knew, in the balance, while the
risks of the interview between her and the Princess
seemed to grow as the time approached.</p>

<p>The Princess arrived first, and I went to her immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she come?&#8221; was her first question, eagerly asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not yet time; but I think she will come. Do
you know what happened here last night?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>&#8220;I have heard something, but would rather hear it
all from you. It was good news, I believe&mdash;but it was
sure to be, you are so zealous in my cause,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Tell me everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>I told her and she listened, deeply interested, her
eyes watching my face as I spoke. At the close she
smiled and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;One would think from your telling, Count, that you
had been merely a bystander instead of the prime
mover in it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Zoiloff did more than I, for it was he who
detected the miscreant. The rest was simple enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then should I keep my feelings and words of
thanks for him, and think of you as one who serves
me, as it were, by routine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are all devoted to your service, Princess,&#8221; I
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one more faithful than the others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None less faithful than myself, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like that standard. Pray Heaven that you are
right, for then I am a lucky woman indeed;&#8221; and her
eyes shone with a light that was like to dazzle me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be on your guard this afternoon with the
Countess Bokara,&#8221; said I, after a pause I found embarrassing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am always on my guard&mdash;except, I think, with
you,&#8221; she added, musingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, you will not let her approach too close to
you. I know her to be a dangerous woman, capable
of any madness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be there,&#8221; she said, with an accent of
trust in me which I read with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;But still she must not come too near you. Infinite
mischief might be wrought in a single unguarded
moment.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>&#8220;You think she may even try to murder me in your
presence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe her capable of any desperate deed; that
is why I urge you,&#8221; I cried, very earnestly.</p>

<p>She smiled, let her eyes rest on mine with a look
that seemed as tender and warm as a ray of summer
morning sunshine, while a faint blush tinged her
cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not cause you a moment&#8217;s needless anxiety;
you have had too many on my account already,&#8221; she
said gently; and in the pause that followed a servant
entered to say that the Countess Bokara was waiting
to see me.</p>

<p>We had arranged that I should see her first alone,
and I found her in a mood of jubilant and boastful
confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you would come round to my views, Count,
though I confess I did not think the effect of what I
said yesterday would be felt quite so quickly. I was
disposed to give you at least three or four days, but I
like you better for your promptness.&#8221; She spoke exultingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so confident as yourself that our interview
will end to your liking,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am confident, and have even more reason for it
than you at present dream. You may prepare yourself
for great news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not good at riddles. What news do you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I do not consider your help so necessary as
I once thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>That there was some new danger beneath her words
I was certain, but what it was I could not guess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand you,&#8221; I said shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A child could see that. I like the look of perplexity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
and fear on your face;&#8221; and she laughed in a
hard, sneering tone. &#8220;You have been very useful to
me, after all, though you do not know it. What you
showed me yesterday gave me the clue; and I have
been merciful&mdash;in a way, very merciful. Death is
ever sweetest to a woman when it comes, or seems to,
from the hand of one she loves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a pleasant wit, and your laugh fits it
well,&#8221; I said drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;A jibe moves you more quickly than a threat, my
friend. And this is a jibe in which you have had unwittingly
a big share;&#8221; and her bitter tone was in full
harmony with the hard, confident glance which she
levelled at me. &#8220;Did you think I could be merciful
even to those I hate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you come to do no more than discuss your
own qualities?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not come to be your dupe,&#8221; she retorted
fiercely. &#8220;You have discovered my spy, I find, and I
congratulate you on the clever stroke with which you
have blinded his eyes. But it is too late, Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man was caught last night in the very act of
spying, and narrowly escaped with his life. He confessed
you had employed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She waved her hand, as though the matter were
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had served his turn, let him go. I have no
longer need of him; and, of course, you would have
killed him had your last night&#8217;s meeting been anything
but a clever ruse. But you scared his poor wits out of
him&mdash;not a very brilliant or difficult achievement perhaps&mdash;and
by now he is off to the frontier as fast as
his shaky legs will carry him. But that is nothing.
Tell me, Count, what would you do if within an hour
you were to hear that your Princess had fallen dead?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>&#8220;Probably I should seek out her murderess, and kill
her,&#8221; I replied hotly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good; then I was right. You do love her, eh?
Then listen. She trusts you, of course, trusts you
blindly and implicitly; and if you sent her a little
pretty gift, a little gentle act of courtesy from so gallant
and faithful a servant, would she prize it, think
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to discuss such matters with you,&#8221; I
answered; but in my heart felt glad indeed that the
Princess was safe in my house at that very moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t wear your heart on your sleeve, you
mean. Men of your sort always think they do not.
And yet the knowledge of the love of such a man
would be precious to many women. That is how you
have been useful to me. Now can you read the
riddle?&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought I could, but made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday, when I was here, you showed me what
you could not hide from my eyes, that this woman had
drawn you to her, as she has drawn hundreds of others.
But this time she has dared to draw you from allegiance
to me;&#8221; this with a touch of sudden passion,
which passed instantly as she continued in a tone of
exquisitely modulated softness, suggestive of the purr
of a tigress.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I left you I saw how I could use the secret
I had surprised. By now I have done my work, so I
may speak frankly. I shall not want your aid now.
Thinking that the Princess might be pleased with a
little token from her latest lover&mdash;you need not wince,
it does not matter now who knows your secret&mdash;I sent
her in your name a little emblem of your devotion.
And what more fitting emblem could there be than a
rare and beautiful rose?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>&#8220;It was an unwarrantable liberty, Madam,&#8221; I cried,
with a flush of anger. She laughed at my indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was more than an emblem of devotion, for
it carried in its soft, sweet petals the essence&mdash;of instant
death. You know these things are common in
this East of ours. One scent of that rose, enjoyed, no
doubt, with a murmur of your name, and a thought of
your welcome little courtesy&mdash;and I and my Prince
were rid of her forever.&#8221; A light of malignant triumph
flashed out of her large dangerous eyes as she finished:
&#8220;I shall not need your dagger now, nor the other
weapons of your trade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that the Princess is dead?&#8221; I asked
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The news will soon be spread abroad noisily
enough; and you may find it sufficiently embarrassing
to explain your share in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the malice of a devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a sweet death for her. Was I not right
when I said I was merciful?&#8221; she cried, with another
hateful laugh. &#8220;And now I have come to warn you,
that you may fly if you wish while there is yet time.&#8221;
She gloated in triumph over my silence, which she
read as that of consternation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a brave woman,&#8221; I said at length. &#8220;If
what you said were true you might have guessed that
you would not leave this house alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; she cried daringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, as to intent, perhaps. But the Princess herself
is safe, and here in this house waiting to see
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is false,&#8221; she said fiercely. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
you;&#8221; and she stared at me, the veritable type of
disconcerted fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; I replied shortly; adding sternly: &#8220;And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
true, too, that though you failed in the act, you shall
answer for the intent.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was magnificent in her rage, as she stood at bay,
staring open-eyed at me; and for many moments not
a word was spoken by either of us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see her!&#8221; she exclaimed at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not alone,&#8221; said I significantly. I rang the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the Princess Christina we will wait upon her,&#8221;
I said to the servant, and a minute later the two were
face to face, while I looked on, all anxiety and apprehension
as to the result.</p>

<p>They stood for a moment looking at one another;
the Princess calm and dignified, in an attitude of
queenly grace, her speaking, lustrous eyes alight with
the hope with which she had sought the interview.
But the hope was quickly clouded with a dash of anticipative
disappointment, caused by the Countess
Bokara&#8217;s vehement passion and hate which envenomed
her fiery glances, and spoke in every straining movement
of her lithe sinuous body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness surely does me great honour in
this reception,&#8221; said the Countess scornfully, breaking
the short silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry we have not met before,&#8221; was the
mild, temporising reply. &#8220;I would have gladly seen
you to remove your too evident prejudice against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard that you are accustomed to rely much
upon the attractions of your beauty. But I am not a
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am desirous only of disarming by mutual understanding
so powerful and, as I have too much reason
to know, so bitter an enemy. Tell me, Countess, why
are you so bitter against me?&#8221; The tone was very
gentle, almost solicitous, but I could see that the
other&#8217;s sneer had gone home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>&#8220;Why should I tell you what you must know full
well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If people speak truly of you we have assuredly the
same end in view&mdash;the welfare of Bulgaria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not half a Russian, and the tool of tyrants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; and the Princess&#8217;s eyes flashed. &#8220;Your
agent has discovered our real designs and carried them
to your ears. You know now our cause is the cause
of freedom, and that we are no more the tools of Russia
than you can be. Why, then, say this? And why
my enemy?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was astonished and not a little dismayed by her
frankness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your conversion has been rapid. It is but a few
nights since your friends, impelled by zeal for you and
for your cause, tried to murder me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was not done with my knowledge. God
knows I would not spill a drop of blood. What would
your death profit me or the end I have in view? Do
you think I am so mad as to wish the country to believe
I desire to rule by terror, the sword, and the
secret dagger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They do believe it!&#8221; cried the Countess in a tone
of hate; &#8220;and they do not wish you to rule at all.
Who has called you to take the place of the Prince, to
plot against him, and to drive him from the throne?
What are you doing but nurturing and fostering the
villainous ingratitude of the people, that by this act of
double treachery you may mount the throne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget, the Prince is himself resolved to abdicate,&#8221;
I interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221; she asked hotly, turning upon me.
&#8220;Why, but that the plots which the Princess here
and those in league with her have organised against his
life are driving him away?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>&#8220;This is no work of mine, Countess. Before my
name was ever mentioned, before the thought of my
ever taking the throne was ever suggested, the Prince&#8217;s
position had become untenable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because your allies, these hateful Russians, had
made it so in preparation for your coming, or the
coming of some other tool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But now that you know I am acting not for, but
against, them, the cause of your enmity, if this be the
cause, is removed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish me to join you, then, to swell the
train of your slaves?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to disarm your hostility.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To suborn me from my allegiance to my Prince,
you mean?&#8221; Her answers were growing in bitterness
and vehemence each time she spoke. &#8220;Your Highness
mistakes me. I am no traitor to my sovereign.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Prince is bent on abdicating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you and others are driving him to it. You
ask why am I your enemy. This is the reason, or one
that will serve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have others.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_144.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;MY INTERPOSITION WAS ILL-TIMED AND UNFORTUNATE.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Page <a href="#Page_145">145</a>.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I hate you. Is that what you wish me to say?
I hate you. Is it as musical for you to hear it as for
me to speak it? I hope it is. I hate you, and thank
my God that I have a chance of telling you the truth
to your face.&#8221; Her passion, only lightly held in restraint,
broke its bounds now, and her eyes flamed, and
her lips quivered with the rush of it. &#8220;What have you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
ever done in regard to me that has not earned that
hate? Where are the men, good and true to the Prince
and myself, that you have lured away from me? What
are your actions, one and all, but those of deadly antagonism
to me? Am I a craven sheep that I shall see
my friends alienated, my Prince threatened, my cause
destroyed, and my very life attempted, and only bleat
a few baa-words of thanks to you for your gracious
thoughts of me? God has not inspired my heart with
that meekness, and while I have breath to breathe, a
voice to speak, and hands to do, I will be your enemy.
Is that enough, your Highness?&#8221; She spoke with such
furious vehemence that at the close she was breathless;
and she clenched her hands, and glared with hate at
the Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not done the things you say. I could not
do them,&#8221; said the Princess, in a tone whose calmness
did not hide from me the ache of disappointment in
her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is easy to deny. It costs but a breath,&#8221; was the
sneering answer. &#8220;But you ask me will I cease to be
your enemy?&#8221; she added, her eyes flashing dangerously.
&#8220;I will&mdash;on one condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One that will at least test your sincerity. Give up
this enterprise of yours; cease to persecute my Prince,
and I will cease to be your enemy.&#8221; She put the conditions
with a leer of malice, and stood waiting for
the answer with a curling lip and insolent mien.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not persecuting the Prince, and from my heart
I declare that if Bulgaria could be freed by him I would
serve him only too gladly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think no good can come of prolonging this interview,&#8221;
I said, for I could not bear to hear the ring of
insult in every word which the Countess uttered. But
my interposition was ill-timed and unfortunate. Turning
partly toward me the Countess said, in a tone of
simulated submission, the irony of which was maddening:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness&#8217;s newest and most faithful adviser
would spare your ears the blunt utterances of truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
from my rough lips. A renegade is always solicitous
to temper the wind for his latest mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>I drew a deep breath of rage at the insult and the
foul slander insinuated with such devilish adroitness.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count is right, Madam, I must admit my defeat,&#8221;
said the Princess haughtily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must ask you to withdraw, Countess,&#8221; said I
sternly.</p>

<p>She laughed with wanton insolence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no servant of yours to be bade to do this or
ordered to do that. I came to this interview to please
you, I shall leave it to please myself;&#8221; and she drew
herself up to her full height in defiance. Then she
laughed again a loud, ringing laugh, forced, of course,
but a clever parody of spontaneous merriment. &#8220;Upon
my word, this is a pretty scene, and I have vastly enjoyed
it. I have, alas! no weapon with me save my
tongue, or there should have been a different ending,
I do assure you. But that I can use. You have shrunk
from the truth to-day, as the Count here shrank yesterday,
when I discovered the secret of his warm allegiance
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, Madam!&#8221; I cried hastily, fearing what her
rash tongue would say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he not earnest, your Highness? Is he not a
man to be proud of? To warm a woman&#8217;s heart? I
told you just now of men you had won away from my
Prince and me&mdash;here stands the latest of those renegades,
a man who loves you.&#8221; She uttered the words
with an accent of assumed sincerity. &#8220;I congratulate
you, Princess, upon your conquest. I cannot hope to
regain for my Prince a man who is aflame with a newborn
passion for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is monstrous,&#8221; I cried, my face flushed with
anger and concern. &#8220;If you do not leave the room, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
shall summon my servants that they may remove
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She faced me unflinchingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dare not,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then be silent, and end these ill-timed jibes, and
leave the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jibes? Is that a jibe?&#8221; And she raised her arm
and waved it to where the Princess Christina stood,
her face covered with deep ruby blushes. &#8220;An unconventional
love avowal, at any rate. You are a brave
man, Count Benderoff, and I do believe that much
rarer thing, a modest one; but at least you should not
quarrel with me because I tell the Princess that you
love her, and let you see by the surest token that a
woman can give that she loves you in return.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the Princess sank upon a chair and concealed
her face in her hands, between the white fingers of which
the deep red glow was showing.</p>

<p>I turned away and would not let her think I had
seen it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your cowardice and insolence have drained my
patience,&#8221; I said fiercely to the Countess. &#8220;Come,&#8221;
and I went to the door.</p>

<p>She stood a few seconds, as if hesitating whether to
defy me longer, and glanced in infinite triumph at the
troubled figure of the Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the interview has not accomplished your object,&#8221;
she cried, &#8220;at least it has not been without interest;&#8221;
and with a last insolent, exultant laugh, she swept out
of the room, followed closely by me, more resolved
than ever to cage this angry, dangerous tigress.</p>

<small>THE COUNTESS&#8217;S RUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> we crossed the hall she turned to leave the house
by the front door, where Zoiloff was standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something still to say to you,&#8221; I said
shortly, as I opened the door of the room where I had
seen her before this futile interview.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish to thank me, I suppose, for having been
the means of revealing to each of you the other&#8217;s
love,&#8221; she answered, with another of her flaunting
laughs; though she changed quickly and said: &#8220;You
may spare your thanks. I had a purpose&mdash;and you
will soon learn the reason. I am a dangerous woman,
for all your contempt of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too dangerous to be at liberty, Countess,&#8221; I
answered curtly. &#8220;It is to tell you that I have brought
you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? That you will dare&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
The words died away as she read my purpose in my
eyes, and the first symptom of fear I had ever seen in
her showed itself, only however to be at once crushed
out of sight. One of her bitter sneers followed. &#8220;So
I have put my foot in a trap, you think, and your
lovely Princess is but a paltry decoy. A truly royal
part for the august ruler that is to be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your railing falls on unheeding ears, Countess. I
have made my decision.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>&#8220;You are an ingrate, my lord the Count; and in
your haste to strike at me you are forgetting the wound
you do to your Princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your insulting references will not turn me from
my course,&#8221; I said shortly, my anger against her burning
like a fever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then shall I say you honour yourself and the
woman you love by imprisoning me for discovering
and revealing your love secret; and that you give
proof of your courage by keeping me here that you
may stay and gloat over your victim?&#8221; I saw her
start as some fresh thought struck her, and she looked
sharply at me and appeared to search her memory
rapidly. Then she smiled the same exultant smile that
I had noticed before, while a dangerous light came
back to her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not attempt to escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be useless&mdash;the house is sufficiently guarded,
and we have prepared for your reception.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am content if you but give me your company,
for you are a man on whose feelings it is a delight to
play, and should make a pleasant gaoler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not be your gaoler, but you will be in safe
hands. I have only to warn you that any effort to
escape my custody will be useless. You probably know
me well enough by this time to be sure of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of one thing&mdash;you will not keep me
here. Let me give you my reasons.&#8221; There was again
a sudden but complete change in her manner, as she
spoke in a calm, collected tone. I distrusted her every
mood, this calmness as much as any.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stay to listen. I wish you merely to understand
that it will avail you nothing to beat against
the bars of your cage.&#8221; As I spoke I turned to leave,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
and with a quick rush, while my eyes were off her, she
was at the door as soon as I. I put my hand to it to
prevent her opening it, and to my chagrin she locked
the door herself and put the key in her pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have that to say to you which cannot wait even
to suit the woman you love. If I must stay here, so
shall you;&#8221; and she walked to the other side of the
room and threw herself into a low chair, from which
she looked at me defiantly.</p>

<p>This man&#339;uvre perplexed me vastly. I was all unwilling
to remain, and yet I could not leave now without
either a struggle to get possession of the key or
by summoning assistance to have the door broken in.
I cursed myself for my folly in having allowed the key
to remain on the inside, although I could not have
foreseen this dilemma.</p>

<p>What was her object? Had she any beyond the
desire to keep me in the room while she loaded me
with her invective and reproaches? What had been
the thought which had struck her, and which had
seemed to lead to her sudden assumption of calmness?</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it strange that I should wish for your
company, Count?&#8221; she asked in a voice soft and gentle
enough to have been the medium of a love message.
&#8220;For all your ungentle treatment of me and for what
I deem your faithlessness, I can find it in me to admire
you. I have said some bitter things to you, I know.
Forget them. Take them for the ravings only of a
violent woman&mdash;or better, the revilings of a disappointed
one. It is no light disappointment to lose
such a man as you.&#8221; Her tone was one of subtle witchery,
tinctured with a sadness that might have sprung
from a genuine regret. But I knew her; and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
time she was speaking with this cat-like softness I was
racking my brains for the reason of her action.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t give me that key, I shall summon help
and have the door beaten in,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I am in
no mood for any theatrical display.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will make a bargain with you. To summon your
servants and have to admit to them that you have been
locked in by your own prisoner will make you very
ridiculous. The strong, clever leader of this great
movement caged by a woman! But I will not banter
you, and will not make you even ridiculous. Listen to
my reasons and you shall have the key. Refuse to listen,
and do what you please. You shall not have it from me
if I die in defending it. It will be quicker to listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;State them quickly. I will give you three minutes,&#8221;
I said, reflecting that what she said was true,
and as blind as a fool of a bat to her real intent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will put them very shortly,&#8221; she answered, speaking
in a slow, deliberate tone, altogether foreign to her
usual habit. &#8220;You love the Princess and she loves
you. You are angry with me because I have discovered
your secret; but do you suppose that the Princess
could endure that Bulgaria should think she decoyed
me here that she might imprison me? That is what
they would think first. But when the truth is known,
as it must be some day, will her woman&#8217;s heart bear
the reproach that she imprisoned me because I surprised
her and your secret and told you of it? Is your love
so guilty a thing that the bare mention of it is a reason
for consigning me to a prison unheard and untried? Is
that how a pure Princess can start her reign? Is the
avowal of such a love so base an act that anyone a witness
of it must be hurried to a gaol to silence her?
Think you these are means by which she will conciliate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
her new people? Or, taking another reading, can you
believe that the Bulgarian people will love a ruler
whose ruthless instincts of tyranny are manifested even
before she touches the steps of the throne, by dragging
away a rival for a man&#8217;s love and thrusting her into an
impromptu gaol because the regular prisons of the
country are not available? No, I tell you; you dare
not do this thing, and your Princess dare not lend
herself to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I listened coldly, but not without concern, for I saw
the strain of probability that underlay her malicious
ingenuity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not imprisoned for any such act as you
pretend, but because you would betray the facts your
spies have discovered; and, if you want an additional
reason, because you have dared to attempt&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I stopped, and dashed my hand to my head in horror.
In a moment I saw her cursed intention.</p>

<p>I had said no word to the Princess about the deadly
rose which this woman had sent to her in my name;
and this fiend, guessing by her woman&#8217;s instinct that
the Princess would hurry away after what had been
said about our love, had imprisoned me here to delay
me, so that even now at the last moment the devilish
scheme might succeed. And I, like the fool I was,
had been duped by her infernal cunning.</p>

<p>I felt like a madman. She saw by my agitation
that I had guessed her scheme, and before I could
move she sprang from her chair, and rushed to the
door to put her back to it, facing me like a wild beast
at bay, to fight for the last few moments that might
be so vital to the success of her plot.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look agitated, Count. You are not going to
leave me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>&#8220;Stand aside, you fiend, or I won&#8217;t answer for myself.
I know your object now. Stand aside; do you
hear?&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not. Touch me if you dare.&#8221; But the life
of the Princess was at stake, and I thought of nothing
else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zoiloff! Zoiloff!&#8221; I shouted at the top of my
voice, and, seizing the Countess by the arm, I strove
with all my force to drag her from the door. She
fought and struggled like a wild cat, and her strength
was so great that for a while she resisted all my efforts,
clinging with desperate tenacity to the handle of the
door, the lever of which gave her a secure hold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you call, Count?&#8221; came Zoiloff&#8217;s answer in
muffled tones through the heavy door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the Princess Christina gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, some minutes since;&#8221; and at the words a
light of Satanic triumph shone in my companion&#8217;s eyes,
and seemed to give her fresh strength for the struggle.
Every moment was precious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get help and burst this door in,&#8221; I shouted; but
even as I shouted the words the thought of the minutes
that would be thus wasted maddened me, and I
resolved to take the key from the Countess&#8217;s pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;You force me to this,&#8221; I said between my teeth,
and, seizing her round the waist with one arm, I held
her in a grip of iron while I plunged my hand into her
pocket. To use up the last possible moment she
struggled with frantic energy, writhing and twisting
and hindering me till I vow I could have killed her.
My blood was up, and the thought of Christina&#8217;s danger
urged me to spare no violence, and half a minute
later I had secured the key, and hurled the woman
away from me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>As I opened the door, Zoiloff and a couple of men
with axes had come up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God! what has happened?&#8221; cried Zoiloff,
falling back before my looks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep that hell-cat safe till I return,&#8221; I shouted,
and, hatless and dishevelled as I was after the tussle
for the key, I dashed out of the house, and ran at my
top speed through the street.</p>

<p>By good fortune I met one of my grooms exercising
a horse close by the house; and before the man could
recover from his surprise I had half pulled him from
the saddle, clambered up in his place, and was clattering
at full gallop towards the Princess&#8217;s house, heedless
of all or any that came in my path.</p>

<p>The moment I reached it I jumped off, sprang up
the steps, pealed the great bell and thundered at the
heavy knocker, never ceasing till the porter opened
the door with a half-scared face.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess! Quick, man, quick, for your life!&#8221;
I cried like a madman. &#8220;Where is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In her boudoir,&#8221; answered the fellow, staring at me
as if I had been a wild man, as indeed I almost was.
I ran by him and mounted the stairs with leaps and
bounds. On the landing above stood a footman, peering
down curiously at the disturbance.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess&#8217;s room! Show me instantly!&#8221; and
my mien and voice were so threatening that he fell
back pale and frightened, and pointed to a door.</p>

<p>I knocked, but did not wait for an answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you there, Christina?&#8221; I cried, excitedly, not
heeding that I used her Christian name only. &#8220;Christina!&#8221;
I cried again, when I did not see her.</p>

<p>And then, to my inexpressible relief, she came out
from an inner room. She was holding a small package,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
from which the outer wrapper had already been removed.
I rushed forward and tore it from her hand,
saying not a word, and heeding nothing of the look of
surprise and alarm which my wild presence and strange
act had called to her face.</p>

<p>Then with a fervent &#8220;Thank God,&#8221; as I held the
accursed thing safe in my grip, crushing the fragile box
in my straining fingers, I fell upon a chair, and, clasping
one hand to my eyes, tried to fight my way back
to calmness.</p>

<p>The rush of relief was an intoxicating delight, and in
my rapture at her safety I could have shed tears. For
the moment I was utterly unmanned. The agony of
suspense during the minutes since I had learnt of her
danger had well-nigh bereft me of my senses; and the
relaxation of the strain, with the knowledge of her bare
escape from death, made me as weak as a child.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are ill, my friend. What has happened?&#8221;
she asked in her sweet, sympathetic voice, laying a
hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>The touch was like the balm of Gilead to my ruffled
senses, and then a sudden shame fell on me, and in a
moment I realised how strange my wild conduct must
have appeared in her eyes. I remembered, too, that in
my delirium I had called to her by her Christian name.
And at the thought my confused and dizzied wits were
more jumbled than before, and, strive as I would, I
could force no words from my tongue.</p>

<p>My silence alarmed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will summon help,&#8221; she said; but I stayed her
with a protesting hand, and thus we waited while I
struggled for some measure of composure.</p>

<p>Many moments passed in this strained, embarrassing
silence, till I was sufficiently master of myself to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
an effort to speak to her. I rose, still holding the
crushed little package as fiercely as though it were a
thing of life. She looked at me with a smile, intending
it to veil her alarm and anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Princess, I crave your pardon. I&mdash;this package&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
I stopped, stuttering at a sheer loss for words.
A tinge of colour mounted to her face as she said in a
tone much less warm than before, and, as I thought,
not without a note of rising indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the package you sent me, Count Benderoff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, it was sent to you in my name&mdash;to poison
you.&#8221; She started back and stared at me. &#8220;I will
try to explain. I have acted like a madman; I have
been almost one, I think. This thing&#8221;&mdash;holding it up
still gripped fiercely&mdash;&#8220;was sent you to-day by that
woman. By the mercy of heaven it arrived while
you were absent, and your visit to my house saved
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And in a shambling, jumbled, half-incoherent
way I told her what had occurred.</p>

<p>The colour in her cheeks flowed and ebbed as I spoke,
and I saw an ever-varying light in her eyes as they
were bent upon me, now in indignation, again in horror,
and yet again in gratitude mingled with feelings which
now I almost dared to read as my heart dictated.</p>

<p>When I finished my disjointed narrative, she thanked
me very simply, though her agitation, heightened
colour, and tender glances told me how deeply she was
moved. Leaving me for a moment, she returned with
the wrapper of the package and a card of mine, on
which were scribbled my initials in a handwriting much
like my own.</p>

<p>&#8220;This was with the packet,&#8221; she said, giving me the
card. &#8220;But I have never seen your handwriting.&#8221;
I saw in a moment that the spy in my house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
could easily have stolen the card for the Countess
Bokara.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could your servant identify the messenger who
brought it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what purpose, when we know who sent it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a case with which the courts could deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; she cried hastily, shaking her head.
&#8220;I could not do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it does not matter. She is in safe keeping,
and I can mete out the punishment myself. I will
keep this evidence for future use;&#8221; and crushing packet
and card and wrapper together, I pushed them into
my pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you propose to do, then?&#8221; asked the
Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;She cannot be left at liberty with our secret in her
possession.&#8221; Till I had uttered the words I did not
see their double meaning. But the Princess did instantly,
mistaking me indeed, and her face grew so
crimson that she turned away to hide her confusion.
&#8220;I mean the knowledge of our plot,&#8221; I made haste to
add, awkwardly, the explanation serving only to accentuate
my clumsy blunder, and add to our mutual
embarrassment in the pause that followed.</p>

<p>I was mad with myself for the slip, and yet delighted
at what it helped to reveal to me. With an effort I
shook myself together, and said in a tone almost cold
and formal:</p>

<p>&#8220;The sure and certain use she would make of her
freedom would be to tell General Kolfort that we are
duping him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a risk we must run,&#8221; she replied, her voice
low and trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is one we dare not run. It would be worse than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
madness,&#8221; I protested hastily. The thing was impossible,
unless we meant to ruin everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have to be done in my name. And that
cannot be. You must see this.&#8221; The agitation in her
voice was evident, and she kept her face averted
from me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness cannot mean this.&#8221; The earnestness
of my tone moved her, and she cast at me a quick
glance of appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot you see that it is impossible?&#8221; But I felt
I must be deaf to any appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have trusted me so completely that I should
be untrue to you and to all concerned in this matter,
Princess, if I listened to you. Believe me, it must not
be. Her captivity is our only road to safety. We
have dealt with this spy of hers, and she herself told
me that he was flying the country in a panic. She
alone holds this terrible&mdash;this knowledge of our plans,
and if she remains at large, nothing can save our
scheme from shipwreck. You know, even better than
I, what effect a word breathed in the General&#8217;s ear
would have. Believe me, I dare not let her free. No
harm shall come to her. Not a hair of her head shall
be injured; but in our charge she is and must remain.
There is no possible alternative.&#8221;</p>

<p>She locked her fingers tightly in the stress of her
perplexity, and a strained, drawn expression showed
on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; it is impossible, impossible,&#8221; she cried, in
a tone of distress. &#8220;I see the dangers, but this I&mdash;I
cannot and will not do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mocking words which the Countess had spoken
when I was locked in the room with her gave me the
clue to the struggle in the Princess&#8217;s mind, and I dared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
not ask her to tell me her reasons, that I might combat
them. But with me they had no weight.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no matter, Princess,&#8221; I ventured to say,
&#8220;in which any considerations but the most impersonal
reasons of policy can be allowed to prevail. I beg you
earnestly to pause before taking a step that on my
soul I know must be fatal to everything.&#8221; The words
brought a look of flashing reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;You tell me this. Can&#8217;t you see what would be
said of me if I sanctioned such a thing? No, no, no;
I cannot, I cannot, I will not,&#8221; she cried impetuously.</p>

<p>My eyes fell before hers, but yield I would not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you permit me to withdraw now, and we can
speak of this matter another time? Meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanwhile you will do that which will compromise
me in the eyes of all Bulgaria,&#8221; she cried
vehemently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do no more than your safety and that of all
others concerned with us in this matter demands,&#8221; I
answered stubbornly. &#8220;We have no other object but
your safety and success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I will set my liberty on such an issue&mdash;that
I will consent to be held up to the whole country,
ay, to all Europe, as&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She stopped, and a vivid
blush spread over her face, but, drawing herself up
with head erect, she added with a truly royal air:
&#8220;Count Benderoff, as the Princess Christina and your
future Queen, I lay my commands upon you to set the
Countess Bokara at liberty without delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness has no truer follower than I, and
my future Queen will have no more loyal and faithful
subject, but this command I cannot and will not obey.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bowed low, and, raising my head, met her look
with one as firm and resolute as her own.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>We stood thus for perhaps half a minute, and then
a striking change came over her face. Her eyes fell,
and I thought I had won. But it was no more than a
change of weapons on her part.</p>

<p>She came close to me and took my hand in both
hers, and looked then into my eyes with a soft light
that only love could kindle.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you refuse as a command, grant me as a
favour. I plead to you as a woman to do what I ask.
I pray you by whatever regard you may have for me.
Must I plead in vain?&#8221; Her hands were trembling in
mine and her voice quivering as she sought my eyes
and held them with a look of yearning love that left
me no room for any thought but how to please her.</p>

<p>What could I do, loving her as I did with all my
heart, but yield?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>A HOPELESS OUTLOOK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Even</span> while I was on my way from the Princess
Christina&#8217;s house I began to realise the consequences
of the mistake we were making. I had been miserably
weak to give way, and, although my head was half
giddy with the rapturous remembrance of her words
and glances, and dazed with the thought that she had
appealed to my love, I was angry with myself for having
yielded.</p>

<p>I half dreaded to meet Zoiloff. I knew what that
sturdy fellow would say, and was inclined to fear lest
he should make a shrewd guess at the reasons which
had influenced me. One thing was certain, he must
not be present when I saw the Countess; for I knew
that she would blurt out the truth in her sneering,
vindictive tone.</p>

<p>She would publish it, too, far and wide, and in a few
days all Sofia would ring with the secret of my love
for Christina and of hers for me. That alone was
enough to ruin the cause, since it must inevitably
rouse old Kolfort&#8217;s suspicions.</p>

<p>When I reached the house I was told that Zoiloff
was with the Countess Bokara, and I sent for him. I
said in as few words as possible that it had been decided
to let the woman go free, and I gave some more
or less fictitious reasons of policy for it. But they did
not impose on him for an instant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;It is wrong, Count, absolutely wrong, and you
should never have consented. She will ruin everything.
I propose that we just ignore the Princess&#8217;s
wish and keep that fiend close all the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have passed my word, Zoiloff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry to hear it, but I haven&#8217;t; and
there&#8217;s nothing to prevent your setting her free and
my taking her again. Everything is ready, as you
know, and the thing would be easy enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I can be no party to it,&#8221; I answered firmly,
although the notion pleased and tempted me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you may as well throw up the sponge.&#8221; He
spoke angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may still be possible to blind the General&#8217;s
eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are more sanguine than you look or your tone
implies if you think so. I don&#8217;t believe it for a
moment. There&#8217;s always something goes wrong where
a woman is concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will send this one packing, and then we can
consult.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much left worth consulting about,&#8221; he
answered as I left him.</p>

<p>The Countess greeted me with a sharp, shrewd look,
and then her face showed a keen disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have failed, I see. You needn&#8217;t tell me,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not yet a murderess&mdash;at least of the Princess,&#8221;
I returned, harshly, for I hated the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have taken a long time over your rescue and
love business; but I suppose you had much to talk
about. It&#8217;s the way of lovers!&#8221; she cried with a
laugh. &#8220;Besides you had to settle what to do with inconvenient
me. I am afraid I am very much in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
way, Count&mdash;quite as much trouble to you as if you
had remained faithful to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had my way you would not give me much
more trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, then I was right. I knew that she would never
dare to try and keep me a prisoner. Will you see that
a carriage is ready for me?&#8221; She spoke in a tone of
indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have any gratitude in your nature you will
remember that it is to the Princess that you owe your
liberty&mdash;to the woman whose life you have just failed
to take.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And am bitterly regretting my failure. That is my
gratitude. But why cant to me of gratitude. Do you
suppose she has done this for my sake? Nonsense; I
told you her reasons before you went to her. Am I a
fool, that you prate to me in this childish strain? I
tell you I am an enemy, and a woman to be feared.
She is a fool to let me go, and I know it as well as you.
Were the positions reversed&mdash;but there, she has given
you a heavy task, Count, heavy enough to tax even
your cleverness; and you can lay your plans on this
one solid and sure foundation&mdash;that I will do my worst
against you and her.&#8221;</p>

<p>I made no answer, and, ringing a bell, ordered a carriage
to be brought round at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look very solemn, Count,&#8221; she said, when the
servant had left the room and I was going. &#8220;And you
have plenty of reason. But I&#8217;ll do you one favour, and
tell you that I have already begun my work, and have
told that ill-bred soldier who was here and seems to be
in your confidence the whole story of your love for
the fair Christina; and it had a very pretty effect upon
him. But it prepared him, no doubt, for this step,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
and she laughed insolently. &#8220;At any rate you can be
frank with him without that shamefacedness with
which one man speaks to another of his love. What
he is thinking about it to-day&mdash;and I was careful to
sow the seeds of fruitful contemplation in his mind&mdash;all
Sofia will be openly talking to-morrow, including
your new Russian friends. It was injudicious of you,
wasn&#8217;t it, to leave me such a companion?&#8221;</p>

<p>I could endure no more of her taunts, and went out
of the room, closing the door quickly to shut out the
sound of her mocking laughter. When the carriage
was announced I went back to fetch her, and, as if her
malicious instinct could always hit upon the mood
most exactly calculated to jar upon my nerves, she
was now disposed to play the high society dame, and,
with all the airs and graces of a capricious beauty, was
for delaying me to chatter idle nothings, in a tone of
empty frivol, about the weather, the recent ball, and
my health, until I cut her short by saying sternly:</p>

<p>&#8220;The carriage is waiting for you, Countess, and I
have no time for this wearying badinage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you might wish your servants to think
this was merely a call of ceremony;&#8221; and, as if to
irritate me with these little peltings of frivolity, she
continued to chatter in the same tone until she had
taken her seat in the carriage. Then, with a quick
change of manner, and a malignant glance at me, she
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;When we meet again you may find the positions
reversed, Count, for I warn you to look to yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave no sign of even having heard her, and watched
in silence as the carriage drove off.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes our last hope,&#8221; said Zoiloff, looking
moodily after the carriage, as though he would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
given all he was worth to have dashed after it, and
have torn the Countess out of it back to captivity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let us consider what to do next,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to do next, or after,&#8221; he said, in
the same moody tone. &#8220;When such a woman holds
the future of our scheme in her hands we can do
nothing but prepare for the worst, and look out for the
best means of escape. It will soon be a case of <i>sauve
qui peut</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall fight on till it comes, then, and so will you,
my friend, when this mood has passed.&#8221; I took him
into my private room and, putting wine and cigars
before him, set to work to try and shape a course to
suit the altered aspect of affairs.</p>

<p>My own opinion was not much brighter than his;
but I sought to persuade him, and myself too, that
matters might yet be mended. There was one possible
door of hope. The Countess meant to have her revenge,
and, as she had frankly said, we must base all
our plans on her implacable enmity. But she had other
ends than those of mere personal vengeance. She
hated Christina bitterly, but she loved the Russians
no better. Her aim was to keep her Prince on the
throne, and to betray us at once would certainly injure
him by forcing General Kolfort to act immediately,
not only against us, but against the Prince.
The latter would be frightened and jockeyed out of the
throne, to make room, not for Christina, but for some
more pliable tool; and the Countess was quite shrewd
enough to foresee that.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am inclined to believe,&#8221; I said, after we had discussed
the position at great length, &#8220;that she will
seek her ends first by other means than by betraying
us to Kolfort&mdash;some scheme or other against the Princess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
or myself personally, perhaps; but something
which may take time to work out. She will cling to
the hope of retaining the Prince on the throne to the
last possible moment; and she may reckon, as she has
done hitherto, that by removing the Princess the Russian
scheme will be so maimed that the Prince may
be able to retrieve and retain his position&mdash;at all events
for a time. She may now include me in some such
plan of assassination. The question for us to consider
is, then, how soon we can complete our arrangements,
by hurrying them forward at fever heat, so as to make
us indifferent to what Kolfort can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>I continued to urge this from every standpoint, until
I saw with great satisfaction that Zoiloff&#8217;s enthusiasm
began to heat again. But suddenly his face clouded,
and he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you forgetting the strange story she is going
to tell about yourself and the Princess? I know
nothing of it, of course,&#8221; he added, as though in assurance
of his faith in me. &#8220;But if such a tale should
reach old Kolfort&mdash;and she seemed mad enough to
scream it from the housetops&mdash;you can judge what he
may think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a ready answer to it,&#8221; I returned, gloomy
now in my turn at the thought behind my words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean denial. I don&#8217;t like to speak of this,
Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not mean denial only in words. They count
for little enough in a time like this,&#8221; I replied bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess&#8217;s only answer will be the hurrying
forward of her marriage with the Duke Sergius. It is
the inevitable corollary of her decision to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By God, but you are a man, Count!&#8221; cried Zoiloff,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
with a look of genuine sympathy, as if he felt instinctively
what such words must cost me. &#8220;From this
hour I will never again question a single order you
give or decision you take.&#8221; He held out his hand, and
grasped mine in a warm pledge of earnest friendship.
&#8220;We will go on, as you say, and frustrate this she-devil
yet&mdash;or fall in the effort.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long silence followed, in which we were both busy
with our own thoughts; and when the silence was
broken we went on with a long, detailed discussion of
the means to be adopted to quicken our preparations
and expedite the arrangements that should make us
indifferent to any action by General Kolfort.</p>

<p>The work interested us both absorbingly, and while
Zoiloff remained with me, and my thoughts were occupied
in planning the work to be done, I was even
inclined to accept my own arguments that all was not
yet lost.</p>

<p>But when he had left me a relapse came, and I seemed
to be overwhelmed with a sense of the weariness and
futility of it all. I had nothing now to gain. A few
hours had changed everything for me, and all my enthusiasm
had evaporated, like the sparkle from flat wine.</p>

<p>Bulgaria might profit, but what was Bulgaria to me?
I had not been fighting for Bulgaria, but for Christina;
and what prospect was there now for her but the
gloomiest? I had gained the priceless treasure of her
love; but with the very ecstasy of the knowledge had
come the bane that I could never even win happiness
for her.</p>

<p>I laid bare my heart to myself in this bitter self-communing.
I had tried to persuade myself before
that mine was that rare thing&mdash;the rarest on earth,
indeed&mdash;selfless love; but I knew now that that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
been the flimsiest gauze of self-deceit veiling the secret
hopes and desires that had urged me forward. Out of
the inmost thoughts came up now the skeletons of my
lost desires, gibbering and mouthing and mocking me
with the hopelessness of my love.</p>

<p>If I could have made her happy, have helped her to
realise the dream of her life as the Virgin Queen pouring
on this distracted people the infinite blessings of
freedom and happiness, herself a bright, conspicuous
example of innocence and purity to all the world, I
might have been content to worship even while I served
her. But to think of her as the wife of the sensual
brute I detested, forced to submit to his loathsome
endearments, and to smile and frown upon him in his
humours, was like a very torment of hell to me. And
for her it must be ten thousand times worse. Her life,
mated with a man she abhorred, would be one long,
living lie, the canker of which must blight her every
purpose, and destroy every hope in her heart.</p>

<p>And yet I, loving her and beloved by her, was to help
her to this life of fair-seeming misery and honoured
dishonour. I could not and would not, I cried in my
heart&mdash;and yet I knew I must. There was no escape
now from it. As I had told Zoiloff in my despair, the
hastening of the marriage was the one possible means
of averting that instant ruin in which the power of the
at present all-powerful Russian agents could involve
us all.</p>

<p>Harder than all else to bear, however, was the
thought that I myself must pass that inexorable sentence
upon her. She had made it essential by her
shrinking woman&#8217;s fear of how her act would be read
in the eyes of Europe; but it was left for me to show
her the full consequences of what she had done.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>In my frenzy I was tempted to regret that I had
saved her from the infinitely more merciful fate of
death. Deeply as I loved her, I would vastly rather
see her dead than the wife of the man whose wife she
was now inevitably bound to be.</p>

<p>For a moment a wild thought rushed through my
mind&mdash;that I should induce her to fly the country with
me. But the thought was as great a treachery to her
as the act would be treacherous to those whose cause
she championed with such pure-souled enthusiasm. I
recalled with the iciness of a lover&#8217;s despair her declaration
that she would even become the wife of this
man, if no other path were open, rather than abandon
the cause she had espoused.</p>

<p>There was no escape; and when at length I threw
myself on my bed, brain-wearied with the long wild
fighting against the inevitable, it was only that the
torture of my waking thoughts should be reproduced
with all the grotesque horrors of oppressive, sickening
dreams.</p>

<p>I awoke with the dawn, dreading the coming of the
hour that would bring with it the ordeal of the interview.</p>

<p>For myself my course was soon decided. I would
keep my word, and go through with the task of leading
the movement to such a successful issue as we could
yet snatch from the dangers surrounding and threatening
it. But the hour that saw her safely seated on the
throne should be my last in the country.</p>

<p>I was revolving these gloomy thoughts over an untasted
breakfast when Spernow came.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look ill, Count;&#8221; for the struggle had written
its effects in my face, &#8220;Yesterday&#8217;s doings have upset
you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;It is nothing worse than a headache,&#8221; I answered
carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope your nerves are not unstrung. You will need
a clear head to-day unless I have read things wrongly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What next?&#8221; I felt that nothing which could
happen now would either interest or trouble me. I
had lost the one thing which I desired, and life itself
might go for aught I cared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was at a house last night and heard something
which you must know at once. It concerns you closely,
and spells danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221; Feel interested I could not, feign
it I would not.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke Sergius has resolved to force a quarrel
upon you. He has some deadly grievance. I heard it
incidentally, but&mdash;&mdash; Why, Count, what is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>He might well be astonished. The news was the
one thing on earth that could have changed me, the
one thing that might yet change everything. In an
instant my lassitude and despair fell away like a cloak.
My blood warmed, my heart beat fast, my cheeks
glowed again, and life was worth living and risking.
Even if I were destined to go straight to my death at
the hands of the rival I hated, I should have a moment
of real enjoyable life, while, if my hand were true and
my skill what I believed it and I killed him&mdash;&mdash; I
could not stay to think, but in my eager hope that the
news might be true I plied Spernow with question
after question, testing his story, till he might well have
deemed me insane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all the gifts and riches of the earth that you
could bring me, Spernow,&#8221; I cried in my vehemence,
&#8220;there is none I would have in preference to this news.
By Heaven, man, but you have made me live again!&#8221;</p>

<small>&#8220;IF I WERE A WOMAN&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had been together about half an hour, discussing
eagerly the news which Spernow had brought, when
Zoiloff arrived. His face showed that he too had
passed anxious hours since we parted. I received him
with a laugh and rallied him upon his looks, and then
told him the news.</p>

<p>He had not the same intense personal interest in it
that I had, and he received it very differently; though
his friendship made him understand my feelings.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is her first step,&#8221; he said, gravely. &#8220;We must
act warily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A necessity for others besides ourselves,&#8221; I
retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not certain what form his hostility will take.
He may not care to quarrel openly with you, Count;
although, if he does, you know he is not a swordsman
to be taken lightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would serve me no ill turn were he to send his
sword through my heart,&#8221; I answered, and meant every
word I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be an ill enough turn for us, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go to the gallery and see. I have scarcely
closed my eyes all night, and when Spernow came he
found me hipped and down. It will be a good test
for my nerves. If I can hold my own against you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
under such conditions, we need not be doubtful about
this other affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few minutes we were busy with the foils, and I
told Zoiloff to try with all the skill at his command to
beat me. For myself, I tried to make myself believe
for the moment that he was the man whom I might
have to meet, and I put forth every effort. I never
fenced more skilfully or with more spirit, now limiting
myself only to defensive measures and now forcing the
attack with vehement and even fiery impetuosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot hold you, Count,&#8221; said Zoiloff, at length;
&#8220;I have not touched you once, except that graze on
the leg, and you have had me three times badly. If
this were in earnest I should be a dead man. But, remember,
you know my work now, and that I am not
the Duke&#8217;s equal with the sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must take that risk, and shall not take it without
pleasure, I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s not the only risk to be taken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in a despondent mood, my friend,&#8221; I said,
for I knew he referred to what General Kolfort might
do afterwards. &#8220;Let&#8217;s meet them one at a time. This
one faced and overcome may mean much to us; and,
at any rate, will put us in good heart for what may
follow.&#8221; My spirits were now as high as previously
they had been depressed, and once again I was full of
fight.</p>

<p>Zoiloff told me what he had already done to expedite
our plans, and when I went to do my regimental
work even the knowledge of what I had to tell Christina
she must be prepared to do had become less
oppressive and disheartening.</p>

<p>On my return home, however, I found a note from
Mademoiselle Broumoff, asking me to see Christina at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
once. &#8220;General Kolfort has been with her this morning,
and something passed which has upset the Princess
extremely. Although she has not told me that she
wishes to see you, I am sure of it. Don&#8217;t mention
this letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>This alarmed me, and early in the afternoon I was
at her house. I found her looking troubled and agitated,
and so pale that I was filled with concern. She
received me as graciously as usual, but I could detect
a touch of shrinking reserve.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you have no ill news; we cannot, of course,
expect a big scheme like ours to go forward without
an occasional check,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be no check&mdash;none if I can prevent it,
that is.&#8221; She spoke very sadly, and then forced a
smile to her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have had some news, I see,&#8221; I said after a
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have bad news; I have had General Kolfort
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His visit was probably the outcome of yesterday&#8217;s
event.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you come to upbraid me with what you think
my weakness?&#8221; she cried quickly, with a swift glance
of reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed not. But when the Countess Bokara
left me she declared with all the malice in her that she
would do her utmost to ruin us all. I judge that she
has commenced&mdash;that is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She cannot ruin us. Let her do her worst.&#8221; It
was easy to see, however, that the first blow had been
a telling one. Then a thought struck me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can tell you the purport of General Kolfort&#8217;s
message,&#8221; I said quietly. &#8220;He is anxious to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
push forward a certain step in his plans to bind you
to him. I mean, of course, your marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face grew scarlet, and I guessed it was at the
remembrance of the bluntness with which the General
would have told her what he had heard about us. I
could judge well enough the way he would speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen him?&#8221; she asked after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but I foresaw what must happen,&#8221; I answered
gently. &#8220;It was inevitable. The only practical proof
you could give him of the falseness of the rumour
that that woman has set abroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>She locked her fingers tightly together, and her face
was drawn and troubled. My heart ached for her.
Remembering my own sorrow, I could gauge the bitterness
of hers. Presently, in a low tone of despair,
she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The marriage is to take place in three days;&#8221;
and, hiding her face then in her hands, she abandoned
herself to emotions which she could no longer control.
I turned to the window and looked out, that she might
have time to regain some measure of calmness.</p>

<p>Presently I heard the rustle of her dress, and I
turned round and went back to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have caught me in a moment of weakness,
Count,&#8221; she said, smiling through the cloud on her
brow and in her eyes. &#8220;I think you had better leave
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came prepared for the news. Indeed, I came to
tell you myself that you must be ready to hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather have heard it from you;&#8221; and she
smiled wearily. Then, laying her hands impulsively
in mine, she said sweetly but mournfully: &#8220;It is hard
to inflict sorrow like this, and I do not hide from myself,
dear friend, that this must give you pain. Believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
me, that thought is not my least grief in this. If I
were only a woman,&#8221; she cried, with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>Her words and tenderness almost unmanned me. I
had no words to reply, but stood still, holding her
hands in mine and meeting her gaze with glances that
spoke the love I felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no thought but for your happiness,&#8221; I murmured
at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happiness?&#8221; she whispered; and her eyes closed
an instant as she drew a deep breath as of unbearable
pain. Then she mastered her emotion. &#8220;I must
never see you alone again, Count. I ought not to have
seen you now, but&mdash;I am a woman. I felt I must
thank you once alone, and tell you how it wounds me
to wound you thus. Others may think of me as ambitious,
cold, unwomanly, selling myself for a throne,
a heartless creature without the attributes and qualities
of my sex. But you will know the truth. You must
know it, even if I bare my inmost heart in telling you.
You will not think ill of me, though I have made you
so poor a requital for all that you have done and would
do for me. Do you think I am seeking my happiness
in this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me that word. If I know what you are
suffering in this it is because my own heart tells me;
and I dare not utter all that it tells me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a strong man and will fight it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never forget,&#8221; I cried earnestly, my voice
hoarse with passion. &#8220;And never again so long as
my heart beats will it hold a feeling such as that which
fills it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>This pleased her, and she smiled sweetly and tenderly,
while the clasp of her fingers tightened on mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would God it could have gone otherwise for us,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
she breathed, her eyes lingering lovingly on my face,
with infinite sadness and yearning.</p>

<p>I carried her fingers to my hot lips and kissed them
fervently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, go,&#8221; she cried passionately at the touch of my
lips. &#8220;Go, or I shall bid you stay, let the consequences
be what they will.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked up into her radiant face, now fired with her
passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;One touch of your lips, if only to ease my suffering.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ruby colour flowed rich and deep over her face,
and, bending forward, she kissed me on the forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, in pity for me, go,&#8221; she cried, excitedly.</p>

<p>One moment longer I stood, gazing at her with my
soul in my eyes, feasting my senses on the signs of her
love, and then I tore myself away. A last glance as I
left the room showed me that she had thrown herself
back in her chair with her hands clasped in front of
her face.</p>

<p>I rushed back to my house, my head bewildered
and dizzied with the sweet delirium of her avowed
love, and I sat like a crazy loon for hours, running over
and over again in thought all the incidents of the
scene.</p>

<p>She loved me. Nothing could rob me of the sweetness
of that knowledge. All else that could happen
was as nothing compared to that. The plot might
succeed or fall; she loved me. Bulgaria might be free
or enslaved; she loved me. The Russians might
triumph or fail; she loved me. It was the one balm
for every sorrow, one true note of joy in every trial:
she loved me; and I was mad with the delight of it all.</p>

<p>In the early evening Spernow came to me; and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
I remembered with an effort&mdash;for all memory was
swallowed up in the one delicious remembrance of her
love avowal&mdash;that I had promised to go out with him.
I did not care whether I went or stayed; what I said or
did, all was alike indifferent to me; but when he urged
me, I dressed and went with him. As we drove along
he said something, however, which brought my intoxicated
wits together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Duke Sergius will be here to-night, Count. We
shall see what he means to do.&#8221; I laughed so loudly
that he looked at me in surprise. What cared I for the
Duke Sergius? I carried a charmed life, for Christina
loved me. He might marry her: but it was I had her
heart. If he killed me, he could not alter that. And
whether I lived or died mattered nothing now. I
hoped he would quarrel with me. &#8220;To be married in
three days.&#8221; Marriages are not made with the dead,
my lord Duke, I thought, and laughed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he wants to quarrel he will find me ready
enough,&#8221; I said, boastfully and noisily; but before I
entered the house I had put a restraint upon myself
and wore my usual reserve, covering up that mad, wild,
whirling passion that was heating every vein in my
body. I soon saw, too, there was a cause to be wary.</p>

<p>&#8220;His friends are in strong force here,&#8221; muttered
Spernow, as together we entered the room and were
greeted by our host, a man named Metzler, who led us
forward chatting pleasantly about nothing.</p>

<p>There were about a dozen of us in all in the room,
and the first glance showed me that it was intended to
be a wet, wild night. Three or four of the men I knew
to be dare-devil scapegraces, hard drinkers and harder
players even for that city of hard drinking and high
gambling, and it was easy to see by their faces that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
some of them had made haste to begin, for they were
already flushed and excited. It was the kind of party
where an empty glass was considered a sign of discourtesy
to the host.</p>

<p>The Duke was gambling, but saw me enter, and when
I approached him gave me no more than a surly nod
in place of his customary rather effusive greeting. I
augured well from this, but was careful to be particularly
courteous.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Spernow and I were seated at a table
playing some silly card game or other for fairly high
stakes. I felt no interest in it, and cared not one jot
whether I won or lost. I staked moderately and drank
very sparingly, finding my amusement in watching the
flushed eagerness of the men about me; the noisy
laughter when they won, and the muttered oaths when
fortune went against them.</p>

<p>I glanced now and again at the other tables, and I
noticed that the Duke was in much the same mood as
myself, and twice caught him scowling angrily and
darkly at me. Each time I laughed in my heart and
smiled pleasantly with my lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fortune with you, Duke?&#8221; I cried the second
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;My turn is coming,&#8221; he answered, with an expression
that in a dog or a wolf you would call a snarl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t be afraid to back it when it does come.
I&#8217;m winning,&#8221; I said with another smile, as though
cards were the one absorbing thought in my head just
then. But he seemed to put his own interpretation on
my words, for he answered in a surly tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! your luck may change;&#8221; and he turned to his
game again.</p>

<p>After an hour or two a halt was called for supper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
and I observed that the Duke scrupulously avoided
me. I noticed, too, that he had begun to drink much
more freely, and while I chatted with the men about
me I kept a close watch upon all that he did.</p>

<p>As soon as supper was finished the glasses were refilled
and the gambling began again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven that&#8217;s over; now we can settle down
to business,&#8221; said one of the men near me, who had
been a high player and a heavy loser; and that voiced
the thoughts of most men in the room.</p>

<p>An hour later I noticed that Spernow was infected
with the mania for high play. He was staking large
amounts, which I knew he could not afford to lose, and
he was losing them. I gave him a warning look or two,
but he would pay no heed; and to create a diversion I
declared that I had played enough. It was all to no
purpose, however. It did not check him, and it irritated
the men about us.</p>

<p>For that I cared nothing, but it brought the crisis
for which I had been waiting. The men were urging
me to continue, and I was refusing, when I heard the
Duke say to a man at his table, in a voice intentionally
loud enough to be heard by all:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing like cards to test a man&#8217;s pluck;&#8221; and he
accompanied the words with a sneer and a shrug of
the shoulders.</p>

<p>I would not take the words to myself, though I
knew, as did the rest, that they were flung at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather not play again,&#8221; I said to those
about me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose we are to stop, gentlemen, to please
one man&#8217;s caprice&mdash;or cowardice, or whatever you call
it,&#8221; said the Duke insolently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not mind if we resume, Count?&#8221; said our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
host, nervously, trying to fill the awkward pause that
followed the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; I answered, pleasantly, for all
the anger that began to stir in me. &#8220;I will look on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Metzler,&#8221; cried the Duke noisily. &#8220;I
object to that. Lookers-on can see too much and can
make use of their knowledge. If Count Benderoff is
too careful of his money to play, you should ask him
to retire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the third unpleasant thing you have said
about me in as many minutes,&#8221; I said, turning pointedly
to him, but speaking coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; and he laughed insolently. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re
doing a deuced unpleasant thing, and I suppose I may
express my opinion.&#8221; This time two of the other men
sniggered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have merely expressed a wish to play no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you do it with an air of a highly virtuous
priest with a mission to teach us how to behave ourselves.
We don&#8217;t want you Englishmen or Roumanians,
or whatever you please to call yourself, coming
here to set up any canting standard of morals. We
can look after ourselves,&#8221; he sneered, his face flushed
and his eyes glittering angrily.</p>

<p>The situation was fast growing serious, and every
man stopped to watch us two.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done nothing of the kind, as you and these
gentlemen know quite well. It seems that you wish
to insult me wantonly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say that I don&#8217;t speak the truth,
Count Benderoff?&#8221; he cried, rising and coming towards
me.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_180.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;I STRUCK HIM A VIOLENT BLOW AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Page <a href="#Page_181">181</a>.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, this has surely gone far enough,&#8221; said
Metzler, his face pale, as he put himself between us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
hurriedly. &#8220;The Count has only expressed a desire
not to play any longer, and, of course, in my house I
should not think of urging him;&#8221; and he glanced at
the rest, as if asking them to interfere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our host&#8217;s views are my answer to you,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>But the Duke was bent on the quarrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;A very discreet shield,&#8221; he sneered, and then his
passion broke out. &#8220;What I said I maintain,&#8221; he continued
furiously. &#8220;You have tried deliberately to
break up the party with your infernally domineering
interference. I have had far too much of your interference,
not only here but elsewhere. I&#8217;ll have no
more of it. Who are you, to come thrusting yourself
into concerns that are nothing to you? If you don&#8217;t
like our company, leave it; and if you don&#8217;t like the
country, leave that too. And the sooner the better.
This is no garbage-heap for either renegade Roumanians
or cowardly English to be carted here;&#8221; and he
laughed in my face.</p>

<p>My blood boiled at his words, but I meant the quarrel
to go even farther yet, and after a pause of dead
silence I answered, clipping my words short:</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather a hunting-ground where a fortune may be
picked up by any drunken, bankrupt Russian duke,
infamous enough to stoop to any cowardly baseness.&#8221;</p>

<p>He could scarce restrain himself to hear me out
before he flung himself at me in wild, desperate
rage.</p>

<p>I caught his arm in my left hand as it was raised,
and flinging out my right with all my strength I struck
him a violent blow on the mouth and knocked him
down.</p>

<p>In another moment the men had thrown themselves
between us, holding him as he struggled to his feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
and drew his sword, striving to get at me and cursing
wildly.</p>

<p>I was as cool now outwardly as if nothing had happened,
and in my heart a feeling of almost wild exultation
throbbed and rushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are all witnesses, gentlemen,&#8221; I said to the
men near me, &#8220;that from the first this quarrel has been
forced upon me. Lieutenant Spernow, for the present
you will act for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will have your life for this!&#8221; cried the Duke,
mad with rage.</p>

<p>I made no reply. There was nothing more to be
gained by any further taunts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry this has happened here and to-night,&#8221; I
said to my host. &#8220;But you must have seen it was
none of my seeking. You will excuse me if I go.&#8221;</p>

<p>I left, and walked home with a feeling of rare pleasure
at the thought of the coming fight. If I did not
punish him for his foul insult, then surely was I what
he had said&mdash;a coward.</p>

<small>A DASTARDLY SCHEME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as I reached home I despatched a servant
in hot haste for Zoiloff, and when he arrived I told
him what had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;He forced the quarrel on you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. I was willing enough, Heaven knows;
but there was not a man in the room who would not
have to say that I bore his insults till I must have
seemed all but a coward. But I wanted to make this
thing a life and death affair. And it is that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will kill him?&#8221; he asked, his dark eyes
glowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can,&#8221; I replied, shortly and sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. But Heaven knows what will happen afterwards.
Though if the thing gets wind your meeting
may be prevented. Old Kolfort will be mad; and if
he had a tool there, as is most probable, you may be
arrested before morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought of that, or I would have finished
the thing on the spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And gained the reputation of having killed a man
in his cups. Thank Heaven you didn&#8217;t think of it. I
suppose the man means to fight, but, like his master,
Kolfort, he&#8217;s such a snake you never know what he
does mean till he has done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No man who spoke as he did could hope to escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
a fight,&#8221; I replied, growing uneasy at his words.
&#8220;What do you suspect? After a blow, too, he must
fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the sort of man who&#8217;d be capable of anything.
He might insult you openly like that, send the
challenge, and then have you seized secretly and shut
up, and when you didn&#8217;t appear on the ground in the
morning, post you for a coward. I know him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be an infernal move!&#8221; I cried hotly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be reckoned a smart Russian trick,&#8221; said
Zoiloff drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, we&#8217;ll checkmate it. We&#8217;ll have enough men
here to make my arrest impossible; or, better still,
perhaps I&#8217;ll pass the night somewhere else. You and
Spernow can arrange all the preliminaries of the meeting,
and appoint a meeting somewhere to-morrow
morning, but not fix the actual ground until that appointment
is kept by him and his seconds only. I will
be where you can readily fetch me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Yes, we&#8217;ll do that. You&#8217;ll have choice of
weapons. What shall they be? I should choose pistols.
You&#8217;re sure to kill him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He shall have a chance to save his life. We&#8217;ll have
swords. But, mind, the fight is to be to the death.
No stopping for a trickle of blood!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the spirit I like,&#8221; cried Zoiloff bluntly; and
then we discussed the plan I had suggested. He told
me where I could sleep and he and Spernow could find
me in the morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be off at once if I were you&mdash;and, mind,
get a night&#8217;s rest. You&#8217;ll need all your skill, even if
we succeed in bringing him up to the scratch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go the moment Spernow arrives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then take my advice. Let your people have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
horse saddled at once and kept in readiness close to
some back way out. I know these Russian dodges.&#8221;</p>

<p>I adopted the suggestion at once, and, sending for
my head groom, Markov, told him to saddle my horse
and his, where to station himself, and to be prepared
to be away with me for the night; and, lastly, to hold
his tongue. After that I changed hurriedly into an
undress uniform, got together the one or two things I
should need, and joined Zoiloff.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like this long wait,&#8221; he said impatiently. &#8220;I
seem to smell something wrong. Why do they keep
Spernow like this? I should go, Count, if I were you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go till I know the man&#8217;s making a show of
fighting, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Picket one or two of our fellows, then, to give us
warning. The house may be surrounded before we
know anything has happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t necessary. The place is like a rabbit-warren;
there&#8217;s an underground passage that lets out a
hundred yards away, and it&#8217;s there I&#8217;ve told the man
to have the horses. Half a regiment couldn&#8217;t keep me
in if I wanted to get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some infernal spy or other may have found that
out;&#8221; and then, to satisfy him, I sent out half a dozen
men to keep watch.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later Spernow arrived, but not
before Zoiloff&#8217;s patience had long given out. Spernow
explained that the delay had been caused at the other
house, and not by any fault of his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did anyone leave before you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; the meeting broke up soon after the Count
left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Count,&#8221; cried Zoiloff instantly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t lose another moment.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>&#8220;The fight is to come off?&#8221; I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Spernow, in surprise, not guessing
our suspicions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then good-night. Zoiloff will explain everything;&#8221;
and as I turned to leave a servant came hurrying in,
pale and excited, to say that a number of men, some
in uniform, were approaching the house, and had tried
to detain him. The next moment a furious summons
at the front door told us they had arrived.</p>

<p>Before the noise had ceased to reverberate through
the house, I was in the underground passage, hurrying
at full speed to the place where the horses were awaiting
me. Zoiloff&#8217;s suggestion that General Kolfort
might know of the secret passage gave me a twinge of
uneasiness, and as I paused to open the little door of
outlet my fears were more than verified, for I heard the
cries of men as they entered the passage from the house
end. I held a revolver ready as I slipped out into the
night, and at a little distance to the left I caught sight
of a couple of men, just perceptible as shadows in the
gloom.</p>

<p>Guessing that they were after me, and had not known
quite where to lie in wait, I ran swiftly in the opposite
direction, fortunately to the spot where I should find
my horse. Once in the saddle, I did not fear pursuit.
They saw me, despite all my precaution, and raised a
shout, while one of them fired a pistol, presumably as a
signal, and then I heard them come clattering after me.</p>

<p>The shot was answered by others, and the place
seemed alive with men. But I was near to the horses
now, and could see them in the little clump of trees
where I had told Markov to wait.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen any horsemen about?&#8221; I asked, as
I sprang into the saddle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied the groom, but at that moment
the sound of galloping came from both directions.</p>

<p>There was going to be a tussle after all, it seemed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have your pistols. If anyone tries to stop us,
you have my orders to fire&mdash;but only at the horses,
mind. Follow me close.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were on a small heath, and I pricked my horse
into an easy canter in the direction I had to take to
get to the place of which Zoiloff had told me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt! Who goes there?&#8221; and the horseman
checked his steed with a rattle of steel that told me he
was a cavalryman.</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend,&#8221; said I, but not drawing rein.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; came the cry again. The horseman behind
was now coming up fast, and I could hear the sounds
of the others scurrying after us on foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a hurry, and can&#8217;t wait,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt, or I shall fire,&#8221; and I heard him get his carbine;
but I was not going to be trapped by a single
cavalryman, and before he had an idea of my intention
I had carried it into execution.</p>

<p>We were nearly abreast of him, cantering easily,
when I wheeled my horse around, dug the spurs into
his sides, dashed right against the man who had challenged
me, dragged his weapon from his hands, and
flung it on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; I called to the groom, &#8220;as fast as the wind,
and bend low;&#8221; and together we rattled over the heath
at a pace that made pursuit hopeless, even had the two
men behind been inclined for a chase. But they were
not. A couple of shots were fired after us, but as the
darkness hid our forms, and the grass deadened our
horses&#8217; footfalls, they were but random shots, not destined
to find their billets in our bodies.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>After a sharp burst for some ten minutes, I drew
rein and listened. Not a sound. I had shaken off the
pursuit. At the same time I deemed it advisable to
take a roundabout route to our destination, and in this
Markov, who knew every square inch of the country,
was able to guide me.</p>

<p>We reached the place without further mishap; and
Zoiloff&#8217;s name acted like a magic pass-word to secure
the accommodation we needed. Thus my Russian
friends had not even the satisfaction of robbing me of
my night&#8217;s rest.</p>

<p>I woke in the morning, all anxiety to know how
Zoiloff and Spernow had fared, what arrangements had
been made, and whether, after all, we should succeed
in bringing off the fight without interruption.</p>

<p>I could also take a clearer view of the seriousness of
the attempt made to capture me on the previous night.
The more I considered it the less I liked it, for I read
in it a determination on the part of General Kolfort to
remove me from his path, at all events, until after the
marriage of the Princess. He had viewed the fact of
our love as a possible stumbling-block in the path of
his policy, and was resolved to deal with it in his usual
drastic way; and it was easy enough to see that even
after the duel he would continue to pursue me.</p>

<p>Zoiloff arrived while I was in this rather gloomy,
meditative mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been speculating all the night whether I
should find you here, Count, for I could not learn from
the men who came to your house whether they had
caught you or not. They were wild at not finding
you there, and ransacked the place from cellar to roof;
and almost the first place they searched was that underground
passage. I concluded, of course, that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
would have men posted at the other end, and feared
therefore that they had got you in a trap. How did
you escape?&#8221;</p>

<p>I told him briefly what had happened, and that only
his forethought had saved me.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what of the duel?&#8221; I concluded eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All is right, so far, I&#8217;m glad to say. Of course,
the Duke couldn&#8217;t appear to back out in the least;
and his men represented him as full of fight. We had
a bit of a tussle over the conditions, but I wouldn&#8217;t
give way. They wanted me to fix the time and place
at once; but I told them pretty plainly that to do that
might be doing no more than giving an excellent appointment
for making the arrest that had just failed,
and, in short, that it was impossible. In the end they
had no option but to agree, and we are to meet at a
little village about five miles north of here at nine
o&#8217;clock, and then settle the ground. What I propose
is that you should ride on about a couple of miles
further&mdash;I know a splendid place for a meeting there;
your man will probably know the ground; and if I
find no treachery in the wind I&#8217;ll bring them on. If
there is anything wrong, I&#8217;ll fix another spot, and let
you know somehow. But I think it&#8217;ll be all right.
The men acting for him are perfectly straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I assented readily. &#8220;It&#8217;s an excellent plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about afterwards? If you kill him, there
will be the deuce to pay; and I should think you will
have to fly the country for a while at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I shall go back to Sofia and face it out. Men
have been killed in duels before. The fight was forced
upon me, and everything&#8217;s in perfect order. Why
should I run away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Russian dukes are not often killed in duels, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
when so essential to Russian schemes,&#8221; he answered
drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall take my chance of the consequences. We&#8217;re
not so feeble that they can do what they like to me.
I shall face it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How would it be to stop short of killing him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Zoiloff, if you had had said to you what
was said to me, you would view the thing as I do,&#8221;
I said sternly, and he made no reply.</p>

<p>I called in my man then, and Zoiloff gave him precise
instructions which way we were to ride, and where to
wait; and soon afterwards he started to meet the duke
and his seconds. I mounted within a few minutes of
his departure, and as I rode at an easy pace I was very
thoughtful, though exultant at the prospect of the
encounter.</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning. The sun was hot and
bright, but a fresh, invigorating breeze was blowing,
and the country looked beautiful. The hardy, stalwart
peasantry, men and women alike, were at work
everywhere in the fields, toiling with that industry for
which they are famed in all the East; and, save that
here and there were to be seen the ruined homesteads
which told their grim story of the fearful struggle of
a few years previously, the landscape seemed redolent
of the new blessing of content which the better rule of
the Prince had brought in its train, and full of the
promise of prosperity, if only the ban of political intrigue
could be removed&mdash;certainly a land of promise
with a great future under a ruler with such high ideals
and motives as Christina.</p>

<p>As I thought of it, she seemed farther removed
from me than ever. She loved me, and the knowledge
was ineffably sweet; but it was a love that could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
no fruition; and my face darkened as I thought of the
man who was to come between us&mdash;not only to thwart
our love, but also to stand between her and the realisation
of the dream and hopes of her life for these
people. My heart was as iron towards him; and the
bare thought of his foul treachery in this dastardly
attempt to have me branded as a coward&mdash;for I did
not hesitate to accept that theory of his act&mdash;filled me
with an irresistible impulse to take his life. I recalled
his burning words of insult and contumely, and dwelt
upon them till they stabbed and pricked and stung me
to a madness of passion and loathing.</p>

<p>We reached the little village in good time, and
halted at the trysting spot to wait for news from Zoiloff.
This was so long in coming that my patience was ebbing
fast, until I saw Spernow approaching at a hand gallop.</p>

<p>&#8220;All is arranged, Count,&#8221; he said, after I had greeted
him. &#8220;You are to ride back about half a mile along the
road I have come. There is no sign of any interference.
But I have something for you.&#8221; He drew a small note
from his pocket and handed it to me, and turned away
to speak to my servant.</p>

<p>I opened it quickly, little guessing the contents:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I have heard the terrible news of your quarrel with
the Duke Sergius, and that you are to meet to-morrow.
God preserve you from danger. I am going to
ask you the hardest favour that could be put in words.
I know of your skill, and of the terrible provocation
you have received, but I beg you not to have his death
on your soul. Think of what it must mean to us all&mdash;to
me. For <i>him</i> to be killed by <i>you</i>. I pray you,
for my sake.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Christina.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>I stared at the lines in a fever of distraction. At
the very moment when the cup was at my lips, it was
to be dashed away. Just when I had fed my passion,
and had been goaded by the remembrance of the man&#8217;s
foul acts and insults to a vow of implacable vengeance,
I was to do nothing.</p>

<p>I could not grant the wish. The man deserved to
die, and die he should if my arm were strong enough.
I could not, I would not, let him escape me. He had
forced the quarrel, and it must go through. It was a
just cause, and I was in the right throughout; and I
crushed the paper in my clenched hand and vowed the
request was impossible.</p>

<p>Yet how could I face her afterwards and say, &#8220;I had
your plea and would not hearken to it!&#8221; Was ever
man more plagued? I paced up and down the turf
fighting the fight between my thirst for vengeance and
my love for Christina with its desire to grant her wish;
and never had I fought a harder battle.</p>

<p>My love won, of course. I had no motives in life
but those which were inspired by my love for her; and
the thought of myself, appearing red-handed before
her, and of her turning from me in abhorrence, or gazing
at me with eyes of reproach to bid me never see
her again since I cared so little as not to grant her
wishes, was unbearable. But it was hard, cruelly hard;
and I could have ground my teeth in the stress of my
keen disappointment.</p>

<p>I questioned Spernow as we rode together, and he
told me that Mademoiselle Broumoff had given him
the letter, and that it was to be destroyed as soon as
read.</p>

<p>I tore it to shreds and scattered them on the passing
wind, with a smile half bitterness, half love; though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
I would fain have kept the letter near my heart. Then
I fell moody and silent. There was more in the request
than Christina had foreseen. It was not unlikely
to prove my death warrant. To go into a fight
with so expert a swordsman as Duke Sergius was dangerous
enough under any circumstances and at any
time. But to fight him while bound to act only on
the defensive, and to refrain, too, from taking advantage
of such openings as he might give, magnified the
danger many times, and must make the issue less than
doubtful for me. The fight was to be to the death,
or till one of us was so wounded as to be unable to
continue it, and it was clear that, if I was not to attempt
to wound him, it was I who must be struck
down.</p>

<p>It was certain, too, that so expert a fencer as he
would soon perceive that I was not going to press him,
and thus he could fight at his ease and wait to pick out
the moment when he could most easily plunge his
sword into my heart.</p>

<p>If I escaped with my life, too, I had to suffer the
humiliation of defeat at his hands; and I groaned in
spirit at the bondage which my love imposed.</p>

<p>And yet I blessed the gentleness, little regardful of
me though it was, that had inspired the plea.</p>

<p>When we came in sight of the others, who were
already waiting for us, my mind was made up and my
decision taken. The Duke should live, even if it cost
me my life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>THE FIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I dismounted I saluted the others and glanced
sharply at the Duke, who feigned not to notice my
salute, and looked away without returning it. I hoped
I could detect an expression of genuine anxiety on his
face, as if he did not at all relish the turn things had
taken; and purposely I assumed as dark and stern an
expression as I could force into my face. Though I
was debarred from killing him, I would at least act as
if I meant to.</p>

<p>It did not take much time to select the place and
complete the necessary preliminaries, and while I was
making ready I drew Zoiloff aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have a last word with you, my friend,&#8221; I
said earnestly. &#8220;Matters have taken a strange turn
since I saw you; I have had an urgent request from
the Princess not to kill the Duke, and I don&#8217;t hide
from myself that I am now going probably to my death.
If I am to act only on the defensive, I can&#8217;t carry on
the fight indefinitely, of course; and, if I fall, I charge
you on your honour to let the Princess know that my
last thoughts were of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw instantly how grave the prospect was, and
was more moved than I could have believed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have arranged that it shall be to the death,
Count. She had no right to make such a request.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Not knowing the conditions, such a request cannot,
and must not, be listened to. She cannot wish your
death rather than his. Women don&#8217;t understand these
things. You must not be bound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have reasoned it out in my own way,&#8221; I answered
with a smile, &#8220;and I shall observe the condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Heaven, I would have had no hand in it at all
had I foreseen this. But I suppose she does not wish
you to be killed like a sheep, without an effort,&#8221; he
cried excitedly. &#8220;You can wound him, at any rate.
But die you must not. We cannot spare you, Count;
she cannot, she does not, know what she asks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you think it over calmly you will see she is
right. He must not die by my hand, things being as
they are.&#8221; He knew what I meant, and had no answer
to it. He wrung my hand, much affected; and, after
a moment, growled into his moustache:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang the women; they spoil everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; I said, warningly, &#8220;if things go badly
with me, give my message&mdash;but no reproaches. She
must know nothing except that I was beaten by the
Duke&#8217;s superior skill. On your honour, Zoiloff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On my honour,&#8221; he answered; and, as I was ready,
we went forward together.</p>

<p>The Duke eyed me with a look of hate, and it was
easy to see he meant to do his worst. As our swords
crossed, and we engaged, I seemed to feel the thrill of
his passion, as if it were an electric current passing
through the steel.</p>

<p>He fought well and cleverly, but he was not my
match. I had been trained in a better school, and
held him at bay without much difficulty. I was much
cooler, too, than he; and his fiery temper made him
too eager to press the fight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>He made no attempt to wound me slightly, but
sought with the vindictiveness of passion to get through
my guard and thrust his blade into my heart. My
fighting was all defensive; and after a short time my
tactics evidently puzzled him. He thought my object
was to wear him down. This cooled him, and he
began to fight much more warily and cautiously, and
with far less waste of energy and strength.</p>

<p>The first point fell to me, partly by accident. Making
an over-zealous thrust at my body, which I parried
with some difficulty, he came upon my sword point,
which just touched his body and drew blood. The
seconds interfered; his wound was examined and found
to be slight, and we were ordered to re-engage.</p>

<p>In the second bout he changed his tactics, and again
attacked me with great impetuosity. The result was
what might have been expected. He gave me more
than one chance which I could have taken with deadly
effect; and when he saw that I did not&mdash;for he fenced
well enough to understand this&mdash;I saw him smile sardonically.
He might well wonder why I should wish
to spare him. But each time Christina&#8217;s words were
before my eyes and ringing in my ears, and, bitterly
though I hated him, I dared not, and would not, kill
him. Then he wounded me. He thought he had
found the opportunity he sought, and his eyes gleamed
viciously as he lunged desperately at my heart. I
parried the stroke, but not sufficiently, for I felt his
sword enter my side, and for a moment I thought all
was over.</p>

<p>But when the fight was stopped for the second time
it was found that the blow had gone home too high,
and had pierced the flesh above the heart, and close
under the shoulder. The blood made a brave show,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
but there was no danger&mdash;nothing to prevent my
fighting on; and again we had to engage.</p>

<p>It was now with the greatest difficulty that I could
restrain myself to act only on the defensive. The triumphant
gleam in his eyes when his sword found its
way into my body had sent my temper up many degrees.
A man of honour, having such skill of fence as
he possessed, and seeing that I was making no effort
to attack him, and was, indeed, actually letting pass
the openings he gave, would have refused to continue
a fight on such unequal terms. But he grew more
murderous the longer we fought, and more than once
made a deliberate use of my reluctance to wound him
by exposing himself recklessly in order to try and kill
me. He did it deftly and skilfully, with great caution,
step by step, as if to assure himself of the fact before
he relied and risked too much upon it; but, having
satisfied himself, he grew bolder every minute.</p>

<p>It was no better than murder; and, strive as I would,
remembering Christina&#8217;s words and seeking to be loyal
to her, I could not stop my rising temper nor check
the rapidly growing desire to punish him for his abominable
and cowardly tactics. As the intention hardened
in my mind, so my fighting changed. My touch grew
firmer, more aggressive; I began to press him in my
turn, and to show him the dangers that he ran. He
read the thought by that subtle instinct which all
swordsmen know, and, as my face grew harder and my
eyes shone with a more deadly light, I saw him wince,
and noted the shadow of fear come creeping over his
face and into his eyes. He began to fight without
confidence and nervously, dropping the attack and
standing like a man at bay.</p>

<p>I pressed him harder and harder, my blood growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
ever more and more heated with the excitement of the
fight; Christina&#8217;s words were forgotten; and springing
up again in my breast came that deadly resolve of the
previous night to kill him. He read it in my face
instantly, and it drove him to make one or two desperate
and spasmodic attempts to get at me; though I
noticed with a grim smile that now he was cautious not
to expose himself as before.</p>

<p>I defeated his attempts without difficulty, and was
even in the act of looking out for an opening to strike,
when the remembrance of my pledge, and of what my
love would say to me if I killed him, shot back into my
mind, and at a stroke killed all the desire to kill. The
change of mood must in some way have affected my
fighting, as we know it will, for I left myself badly
guarded, and like a dart of lightning his blade came
flashing at me.</p>

<p>I was wounded again; but, fortunately, malice, or
fear, or too great glee, made him over-confident, so
that his aim was awry, and, instead of piercing my
heart, his sword glanced off my ribs, inflicting another
flesh wound, but barely more than skin deep.</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;I RAN MY SWORD THROUGH HIS NECK.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Page <a href="#Page_199">199</a>.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;This can&#8217;t go on,&#8221; growled Zoiloff in my ear, during
the pause. &#8220;You could have killed him half a
dozen times. We shall be here all day.&#8221; The absurd
bathos of the speech made me smile, despite the grim
situation, and the smile was still lurking on my face
when we crossed swords for the fourth time. A glance
at my opponent&#8217;s face was enough to kill any smile,
however; and almost as soon as our blades touched he
commenced again to force the fight as though he
meant to finish it off quickly. So vehement was his
attack, that for a while I needed all my nerve and skill
to defend myself; but I contented myself with defensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
tactics&mdash;for the interval had cooled my temper&mdash;until,
by a little dastardly, unswordsmanlike trick, he
tried to catch me at a disadvantage. In an instant my
passion flamed up beyond restraint, and before there
was time for me to regain control of my temper, an
opening came in his guard, and, unable to stay the
fighting instinct to take advantage of it, I ran my
sword through his neck.</p>

<p>The blood came gushing out in a full crimson stream
from the wound and through his parted lips, dyeing
his shirt front; he staggered back, his sword dropped
from his nerveless grasp, and he fell to the ground with
a groan.</p>

<p>I looked on more than a little aghast at my work.
If he should die! And at the thought the picture of
Christina&#8217;s face as she would meet me flashed before
my eyes, and for the moment I would have given all I
was worth to have called back that laggard thrust.</p>

<p>Zoiloff and Spernow came and stood by me, as I
waited, sword in hand, to know if the fierce combat was
to go on still further. Then his chief second crossed
to us, and in a formal tone said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My principal can fight no longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the hurt dangerous? Will he die?&#8221; I asked,
and the man glanced at me in evident surprise at the
concern in my tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not necessarily. The wound is severe, but the
doctor says the artery has not been touched.&#8221; Then
after a pause he added, as if in involuntary compliment
to the skill I had shown: &#8220;It is surprising that the
fight lasted so long, Count Benderoff. I can bear witness
that he owes his life to your forbearance.&#8221; And
with a bow as formal as his tone he went back to the
others.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>&#8220;We may go,&#8221; said Zoiloff; and I handed him my
sword and then dressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you wounded him. I feared you were
going to let him kill you. He tried his utmost, and
you had one very narrow escape,&#8221; said Zoiloff. &#8220;But
now, where are we to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like first to make quite certain about the
nature of his wound. Will you question the surgeon
yourself? Spernow and I will wait by the horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of your own wounds? Won&#8217;t you have them
dressed? Better run no risks.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had almost forgotten them in my excitement, but
I agreed; and as soon as the surgeon could be spared
from his attendance on the Duke he came and dressed
them rapidly. The one was a mere scratch, and the other
not by any means serious. I had been lucky indeed
to escape so lightly. &#8220;A couple of days&#8217; rest for the
arm would be enough,&#8221; declared the doctor, who was
inclined to be garrulous about the affair until he found
that I made no response.</p>

<p>When he had finished with me, however, I questioned
him as to my opponent&#8217;s condition. He gave me a
learned and technical description of the exact character
of the injury, and then in simple and intelligent language
told me that in all probability, if the wound
healed as it should, the Duke would be a prisoner to
his room for two or three weeks; if it healed badly, it
might be as many months. But he put his estimate
at not more than a month.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no danger of his death?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the least, unless he is imprudent. In a month&#8217;s
time he should be quite able to fight another duel
should he feel so disposed.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw no wit in so grim a pleasantry, for he intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
it as such, and turned away with a hasty word of thanks
for his attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221; asked Zoiloff when we were mounted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back to Sofia,&#8221; I answered promptly. &#8220;I am
going straight to General Kolfort to ascertain the
meaning of last night&#8217;s attempt on me;&#8221; and I clapped
my heels into my horse&#8217;s flanks and started at a sharp
pace for the city.</p>

<small>MY ARREST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> not ridden more than a couple of miles
towards the city when a thought occurred to me and
caused me to draw rein suddenly and call to my companions
to halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything wrong?&#8221; asked Zoiloff, looking about
him anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has just occurred to me that, as I&#8217;m going to put
my head in the lion&#8217;s mouth by going to General Kolfort,
I had better not go unprepared, and I have just
thought of a precaution I can take.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t at present explain to you fully, but you or
Spernow can help me. I must find some place before
I enter Sofia where I can write for an hour or two.
Where can I go?&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought a moment, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The safest place would be back to where you passed
the night. I am sure of those people, and they know
how to hold their tongues;&#8221; and, changing our direction,
we set off for the house at a brisk trot.</p>

<p>My intention was to write out a full report now for
the British Foreign Office, giving a detailed account
of the position of matters in regard to the Russian
scheme, of the part I had played in it, and of what I
believed to be the Russian designs against me. I did
not forget the condition that if I failed the Foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Office were to be at liberty to disown me, and that the
whole and sole responsibility of my present action lay
with me, let the consequences be what they might.
But I calculated that so far I had kept aloof from committing
the Government in any way, and could thus
claim the protection of the Foreign Office should any
personal violence be contemplated by old Kolfort.</p>

<p>I thought out carefully what I had to say, and when
we arrived at the house set to work with a will. I gave
a clear description of the Princess&#8217;s counterplot, and
then added my reason for believing that, although it
was likely to fail now, it could yet be used for the advantage
of Bulgaria and the Balkan States generally.
The Prince had decided to abdicate, and if measures
could be taken from Downing Street to have a successor
to him ready, whether that successor should be
Princess Christina or another, and the abdication so
timed as to fit in with such a plan, it would be perfectly
feasible to checkmate the Russian move. My own
opinion, I declared, was in favour of putting the Princess
on the throne, thus apparently acting in co-operation
and concert with Russia, while at the same time
taking secret measures to prevent any marriage on her
part with a Russian ally.</p>

<p>For myself, I asked merely that, in the event of my
being imprisoned by General Kolfort, the British representative
in Bulgaria might be instructed by telegraph
to press either for my being liberated or brought to
trial. No more to be done than would be done in the
case of an ordinary British subject.</p>

<p>When I had completed the despatch, I drafted a telegram
announcing that it was on its way, and I instructed
my companions how they were to act. Spernow
was to take the work in hand, and to push on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
now for the Servian frontier, and take the train there
for Nish, where I knew there was a particularly energetic
British Consul. If no communication reached
Spernow from me within twenty-four hours of his
arrival at Nish he was to send off the despatch by the
quickest available means, and twenty-four hours later&mdash;so
as to allow enough time to elapse to prevent the
letter being intercepted&mdash;the telegram was to follow.
Then Spernow was to return in hot haste to Sofia to
report to Zoiloff. He undertook the commission very
readily, asking only that Mademoiselle Broumoff should
be told of the reason for his absence, and that Zoiloff
should arrange the difficulties of getting him leave of
absence from his regiment.</p>

<p>Zoiloff and I then resumed our ride to Sofia, discussing
very earnestly the new development of our
affairs and the possibilities which lay ahead of my
interview with the General.</p>

<p>I scarcely thought he would venture to imprison me,
resolute and ruthless as he was in pressing his policy;
and I said as much to Zoiloff, who was, however, more
doubtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;In any case it must make no difference to our
scheme,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You must push on without me,
and hurry forward all the preparations with the utmost
despatch. I should like you to see the Princess and explain
to her precisely what has happened this morning,
although you need know nothing of her message to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; he said drily; &#8220;but I should like
to warn her against imperilling a valuable life when
she doesn&#8217;t know the facts. It may be my turn next&mdash;who
knows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would act as I did, my friend,&#8221; I replied,
smiling; &#8220;I know you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;Well, the conditions would never be the same,&#8221; he
said bluntly; and I did not pursue the point any
further.</p>

<p>When we reached Sofia we parted.</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall I know what happens at the General&#8217;s?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do not hear from me, you may draw your
own conclusion that I am on my way to Tirnova. If
we are not to meet again&mdash;good-bye;&#8221; and I held out
my hand.</p>

<p>He grasped it warmly, and with a ring of true stalwart
friendship he said: &#8220;If they shut you up it&#8217;ll go
hard with me if I don&#8217;t find you. And if they kill you
you have my oath on it you sha&#8217;n&#8217;t go unavenged, if I
have to shoot that infernal old ruffian with my own
hand. It shall be life for life.&#8221; And without another
word, as though he did not wish me to see how much
he was moved, he clapped his heels into his horse&#8217;s
flanks and cantered off.</p>

<p>I avoided my own house purposely, lest some of the
General&#8217;s agents should be waiting there for me, for I
wished it to be unmistakably clear that my interview
with the General was by my own choice; and I did not
draw rein till I had reached the courtyard of his
house. Then, telling Markov to wait for me with the
horses in the street, I entered the house and asked for
General Kolfort.</p>

<p>I could see that my visit caused surprise, and observed
that one or two of the soldiers present made
haste to post themselves so that my retreat would be
impossible. I was shown upstairs into the room where
I had first seen the General, and where, as usual, one
or two officers were lounging. I was kept there about
half an hour&mdash;quite long enough to irritate me&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
then a messenger ushered me into the General&#8217;s
room.</p>

<p>He looked even harder and grimmer and sterner than
ever as he glanced up from his desk and fixed his eyes
on me.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your business with me?&#8221; he asked curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the question I have come to put to you,&#8221; I
retorted, quite as shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I have heard, not quite incidentally, that
you have been sending to my house to inquire for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You appear to have been called away suddenly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Driven away, I should say rather,&#8221; I retorted.
&#8220;May I ask why you have dared to make such an
attempt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dared?&#8221; he returned, with a flash of his eyes at
the word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dared,&#8221; I repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not answerable to you for the steps taken in
the exigencies of State.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exigencies of State you term it. A singular name
to describe an act which in plain terms means that when
one of your chief men has forced a quarrel on me and
challenged me, you would shut me up to prevent our
meeting, so that he might have an opportunity of
branding me as a coward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think you a coward,&#8221; he answered slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor does your Duke Sergius now,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>This touched him, for he asked with evident interest:
&#8220;What has happened this morning? A good deal may
turn on your answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not dead, if that&#8217;s what you mean&mdash;only
badly wounded;&#8221; and I gave him a brief description of
the fight. He listened closely, but without a sign of
his feelings on his face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>&#8220;You seem to suggest that you could have killed
him,&#8221; he said with half a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;His own second said as much to me, and offered to
bear witness to the fact that he owed his life to my
forbearance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very tactful forbearance. And why did you spare
him? From what I hear, there is little love lost between
you&mdash;at least, in the common sense of the term,&#8221;
he added drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had my reasons, and they are my own, if you
please. But now will you tell me the reason for your
conduct?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not consider it safe for you to be any longer
at large.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer was given deliberately, and after a pause.
It showed that his intention was to imprison me; but
I would not let him see the unpleasant effect of the
decision. I smiled and shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;And your reasons?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not accustomed to discuss reasons with
prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you will have to state them in my case.
Englishmen can&#8217;t be packed away like herrings in a
barrel to suit even your convenience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are no Englishman, Count Benderoff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I am a British subject, General
Kolfort, and am resolved to claim my rights as
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved the words aside as though they were of
no account.</p>

<p>&#8220;I warned you when you first came here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you lured me here, you mean,&#8221; I corrected.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you would have to choose in which character
I was to deal with you. Had you chosen then to stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
on your British nationality&mdash;which, by the way, I
question entirely&mdash;I should have known how to deal
with you. Instead of dealing frankly with me, you
chose to remain in Sofia, mixing yourself up with intrigues
against me, and doing other ridiculous things,
until I repeat I cannot any longer allow you to remain
at large. I shall send you to Tirnova, that you may
have time to cool your inconvenient passions and clear
your head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I am content to go. It will be an excellent
illustration for the guidance of Europe as to
Russian policy in the Balkans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When Europe hears of it,&#8221; he returned significantly.</p>

<p>I blessed my prudence as I thought of the despatch
I had sent by Spernow, and at the thought a smile
flitted across my face. He stared at me in some
doubt, not understanding my confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you think I am only a short-sighted
fool, after all, General.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not formed a very high opinion of your
foresight. I know you to be brave and hold you to be
clever in your way; but a little longer foresight would
have shown you that such an ending as this was inevitable
when you decided to meddle with politics here
and to act as my secret opponent.&#8221;</p>

<p>I began to wonder how much he knew of our plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not so lack foresight as to come to this meeting
unprepared, at any rate,&#8221; said I, significantly. &#8220;And
if you throw me into one of your confounded prisons,
the news will soon be buzzing in every Foreign Office
in Europe that Englishmen must be deprived of their
liberty in order to prove Russia&#8217;s devotion to the cause
of freedom in the Balkans.&#8221; I threw the words at him
recklessly, and all his self-restraint could not help his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
showing that the blow went home. He had not expected
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you,&#8221; he said bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the worse for you; but if you were a
younger man, General Kolfort, you would not dare to
say that to my face,&#8221; I added, sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find it no easy task to get your news out
of Bulgaria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had not known it was already safe across the
frontier, do you think I should have been fool enough
to come here;&#8221; and I laughed and shrugged my shoulders,
enjoying his embarrassment. Then I pushed my
advantage. &#8220;But now, I am ready for your men.
Where are you sending me? Tirnova?&#8221; And I got
up as though the prison were immaterial to me.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t relish the piece of bluff, and sat silent and
uneasy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can sit down again,&#8221; he said after a pause.</p>

<p>I threw myself carelessly into my chair again, crossed
my legs, glanced at my watch and said, lightly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tirnova&#8217;s over a hundred and twenty miles as the
crow flies, and if you have any regard for my health&mdash;which,
by the way, may be an important matter to you
by and by&mdash;we&#8217;d better make a start. I&#8217;m wounded,
and a long journey might have a very bad effect upon
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw me a glance of baffled rage; I saw his lips
move, and guessed that a pretty little oath had slipped
out into his moustache unchristened.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mean to brave me out, your journey may be
a much farther and a much quicker one,&#8221; he said after a
pause. &#8220;Mistakes have been made before now, and
explained afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistake and murder are both spelt with an M,&#8221; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
said recklessly. &#8220;But a murdered Englishman is not
by any means easy to explain away.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long tense silence followed. He broke it by asking
abruptly, seeking to catch me unawares:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this I hear about your love for the Princess
Christina?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How on earth can I know what your spies or my
enemies tell you?&#8221; I replied, not for a moment off my
guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you dream of making her your wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t she promised to marry the Duke Sergius?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true that you love her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it were you are scarcely the man to whom I
should bring such a confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your object here in Sofia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be allowed to mind my own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that business, as you call it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My own concern,&#8221; I retorted as sharply as I could
rap out the words. It was as clear as daylight that I
had touched him with my threat, or he would never
continue to question me. I was winning.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does your Government want?&#8221; he asked,
after a pause to recover from his chagrin at my former
replies.</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know&mdash;except to have their subjects
left unmolested?&#8221; I was determined to rub this in,
and I could see he relished this last rub no better than
the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you refuse to answer my questions you leave
me but one alternative,&#8221; he threatened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it,&#8221; I answered lightly. &#8220;You take it, of
course, with your eyes open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been engaged in a conspiracy against the
Russian influence?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>&#8220;I have been engaged in that conspiracy carried on
In the Name of a Woman, if that&#8217;s what you mean.
And, as you are perfectly aware, with not only your
consent, but approval and encouragement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been working secretly for another object,&#8221;
he cried angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you accusing the Princess Christina of treachery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your tongue is as skilful in fence as your sword,&#8221;
he said, smiling grimly. &#8220;But you know my meaning
perfectly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then pack me off to Tirnova&mdash;if you think you
have proof to prove the unprovable; and at the same
time show your hand to the rest of Europe. No, no,
General Kolfort,&#8221; I said, smiling and shaking my head,
as though the thing were no more than a jest, &#8220;that
cock won&#8217;t fight, and you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I regard you and could deal with you as a renegade
Bulgarian officer conspiring against your Prince; a
crime that merits imprisonment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good and plausible, no doubt&mdash;were it not for
the precaution that I have taken to let people in London
know differently. But if that&#8217;s to be your line,
we shall have the gaols pretty full here, and you and I,
General, will be able to resume our interesting conferences,
hobnobbing in one of them on more equal terms
than here;&#8221; and I wagged my head at him again.</p>

<p>The taunt enraged him. His eyes flashed fire, and
a flush of wrath tinged his dried, wrinkled, parchment
cheeks. He sprang to his feet and sounded the bell on
his table furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will put your devil-may-care humour to the test.
You shall go to Tirnova.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; I answered, surprised now in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
turn, for I had not thought he would dare to push matters
to extremes. &#8220;I will tell you one thing. My arrest
will be the signal for that despatch to be forwarded.
If I do not go to Tirnova, that will not go to London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I care nothing for your Government,&#8221; he exclaimed,
all self-control gone in his anger. &#8220;They dare do
nothing, even if they would.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment an officer entered in response to the
bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrest the Count Benderoff,&#8221; cried the General,
pointing at me a finger that trembled with rage.
&#8220;Give up your sword, sir. You are a traitor, unworthy
to bear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do nothing of the kind,&#8221; I said desperately.
&#8220;The man who lays a hand on me may look to himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call in your men, Captain. If he resists, shoot
him,&#8221; said the stern old man grimly, and in the moments
of waiting we looked at each other in silent
defiance. Then came the tramp of men and the clash
of arms in the room without, and a file of soldiers
marched in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must ask you for your sword, Count Benderoff,&#8221;
said the officer, quietly and courteously. &#8220;You will
see resistance is useless.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment I still resisted and refused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg you to save trouble,&#8221; he said again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not,&#8221; I cried furiously. &#8220;If I am to be murdered,
it shall be done here, in the presence of my
murderer;&#8221; and I set my back to the wall and whipped
out my sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoot him down!&#8221; shouted the infuriated old man
to the soldiers, who levelled their guns dead at me.
&#8220;Now, will you give up your sword?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll die first, you butcher!&#8221; I exclaimed, setting
my teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do your duty, Captain,&#8221; said the inflexible old
martinet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Count Benderoff, let me make another request,&#8221; he
said, daring even the General&#8217;s displeasure in his reluctance
to give the command.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; you shall butcher me here.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment of terrible strain followed, and then in
the room without the sounds of some confusion were
heard, and an exclamation of surprise from one or two
of the men there. Quick, light steps fled across to the
room where we stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut that door,&#8221; cried the General.</p>

<p>But the order was too late, and the Princess Christina
came rushing in, her face deathly white with alarm
at what she saw, while with the quickness of thought
she placed herself between me and the soldiers who
covered me with their muskets.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>A WARNING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Princess looked magnificent in the fire of anger
which succeeded her alarm, as she turned to the old
Kolfort for an explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume you will scarcely order your soldiers to
shoot me,&#8221; she said, facing him grandly, her eyes
flashing.</p>

<p>I slipped my sword back into its scabbard, and the
General made a peremptory sign to the Captain to
withdraw his men.</p>

<p>We waited in silence while the order was given, and
the men filed out, followed by the Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remain in the ante-room,&#8221; said the General.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mistake me greatly, General Kolfort, if you
think your soldiers will be needed for work like this,&#8221;
cried the Princess. &#8220;Pray what is the explanation of
what I saw when I arrived?&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought I could best give that, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;General Kolfort had arrested me, and when I refused
to give up my sword had ordered these men of
his to shoot me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this possible?&#8221; she cried, her indignation flaming
in her face. &#8220;And yet of course it is. I have heard
within the last few minutes of what was done last
night and of this visit of yours, Count Benderoff, and
I hurried here, fearing mischief. Thank Heaven, I
arrived in time; but I did not dream such an infamous
act would ever be attempted.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;Infamous is a strong word, Princess,&#8221; said Kolfort
sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I use it because I can find no stronger,&#8221; was the
quick, spirited retort. &#8220;By what right, and in whose
name, do you contemplate such an outrage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The General declared that I was a renegade officer
plotting against the reigning Prince, and that I therefore
deserved imprisonment in the fortress of Tirnova.
The General himself being, of course, so zealous a loyalist,
the thought that anyone should so conspire was
naturally repugnant to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I threw as much irony into my tone as I could, and
ended with an intentionally aggravating and somewhat
insolent sneer. I wished to put as ugly a complexion
as possible on his conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;The matter is one which you and I had better discuss
in private, Princess,&#8221; said the old man, who was
now fast recovering his habitual self-restraint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why in private?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I prefer it, Princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no reason. The Count is fully aware of all
our matters, is one of my most trusted advisers and
friends, and his welfare and safety touch me very
closely. The matter can be settled here and now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are presuming much&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand the word presumption in such
a case, and from you, General Kolfort,&#8221; cried Christina,
proudly, &#8220;and I will not hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If your Highness has no further need of my services,
nor of the influence of my Government in your
affairs, you have but to say so,&#8221; he said in a tone of
calculated menace. But he didn&#8217;t frighten my brave
and staunch Princess, and she answered him in a tone
of queenly dignity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>&#8220;If your services can go no higher than the cold-blooded
murder of my friends and adherents, I shall be
glad for your Government to release you from a position
that you fill in a manner so unworthy of Russia
and so bitterly hateful to myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had drawn a blank in the attempt to intimidate
her, and was quick to see and wily enough to abandon
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet I have not been unmindful hitherto of your
interests,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hitherto they do not appear to have clashed with
your own plans and private animosities,&#8221; she flashed,
with a sting that festered at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is rather a matter of your private feelings
than mine,&#8221; he said, with a significant glance in my
direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not affect to misunderstand you,&#8221; she answered
readily, with mounting colour. &#8220;Our interview
yesterday makes that unnecessary. That, as I read it,
is the real reason at the bottom of this last act of yours.
I gave my word then to marry the Duke Sergius, and
I would have kept it at all hazards. But I did not
mean, and will not suffer, that my marriage with the
Duke should be the death-sentence upon Count
Benderoff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You &#8216;would have kept&#8217; your word. Do you
mean&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; He paused; and how I hung upon her
reply may be imagined.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that, as the Duke has involved himself in
a quarrel, and been seriously wounded for his pains, I
cannot well become his wife the day after to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be no delay,&#8221; he retorted quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Delay!&#8221; she cried, her eyes flashing again brilliantly.
&#8220;Do you think if you had murdered my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
friend here, or if you dared to thrust him into a prison,
that I would ever make a marriage that at the best
must be hateful to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This friendship of yours threatens to be exceedingly
inconvenient; and if you mean to allow it to interfere
with urgent matters of State, we may as well
abandon all our plans, or look for some other means
of carrying them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If a policy of murder is your only alternative, I
agree with you,&#8221; she exclaimed, taking up his challenge
instantly. &#8220;I will not have the steps of my throne
running with blood shed by Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bit his lip in chagrin and manifest embarrassment.</p>

<p>He might well be embarrassed. He had fired his two
big guns&mdash;a threat first to withdraw from her cause and
then to throw her over&mdash;and had found them both
burst at the breech. A long pause followed, in which
I watched his face closely. He appeared to come suddenly
to a fresh decision, and changed his manner
accordingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am sorry to have distressed you, Princess.
What is it you wish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not have Count Benderoff, or any of my
friends, subjected to interference at the hands of your
agents. Their personal freedom and safety are my
special charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count is at liberty to leave,&#8221; he replied on the
instant, in his more customary curt, decisive tone.
&#8220;And I trust his future actions will not bring him
again in conflict with me. He may take this as a
warning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done nothing in this case, and need no
warning,&#8221; I said warmly. &#8220;If you allege anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
against me, I am prepared to take the consequences,
and demand to stand my trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no occasion that calls for mock heroics,&#8221; he
sneered. &#8220;In my opinion you should be in Tirnova;
but the Princess has thought well to interfere in your
behalf, and I bow to her wishes&mdash;for the present. That
is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the second time I owe my safety, and probably
my life, to you, Princess,&#8221; I said, advancing to
her. &#8220;I have no words to thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish to show your thanks you had better
stop that despatch you told me of,&#8221; interposed the
General, not without a note of concern in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need for it if I am to remain at liberty,&#8221;
I answered, half disposed to smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ashamed there should have been this need for
my interference, Count,&#8221; said the Princess, looking at
me and smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust that there may come a chance for me to
prove my gratitude,&#8221; I replied, scarce daring to meet
her eyes; and with that I withdrew.</p>

<p>As I passed through the ante-chamber I was stopped
by the Captain, whose men remained there on guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I am to let you pass, Count,&#8221; he said most
courteously.</p>

<p>&#8220;General Kolfort has this moment said I am at
liberty to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know how strict our discipline is. Will you
wait while, as a matter of form, I obtain his confirmation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most willingly,&#8221; I asserted. He went to the General&#8217;s
room, and in a moment returned smiling and
holding out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am delighted. I know of you, of course, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
believe me, I have never passed through a more embarrassing
minute in my life than that in his room.&#8221;
His manner was so unaffectedly frank and friendly that
I shook his hand cordially, and he came with me down
the stairs and out into the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard an account of last night&#8217;s proceedings from
one who was at Metzler&#8217;s house, Count; I hope you
do not judge us all by such an instance. I have just
heard also what occurred this morning;&#8221; and in his
tone and manner he contrived to convey a genuine
compliment to my skill. &#8220;The Duke is well punished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to hear how he progresses,&#8221; I said,
as my man brought my horse up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear that you have an excellent shooting gallery
at your house, and that you are a remarkable shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you care to come and see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Immensely, and perhaps to try the foils with
you;&#8221; and his face lighted as though I were granting
him a great favour when I asked him to dine with me.
I rode off, thankful indeed that I was still free, speculating
whether I could in some way attach this Russian
to me; and, what was still more important, wondering
what lay behind the sudden change in old
Kolfort&#8217;s manner, and whether he was concocting some
further subtle plan against me.</p>

<p>Before I reached my house I had resolved on an
important step, as the result of these later developments.
After I had sent to Zoiloff to let him know
what had happened, I wrote a fresh despatch to send
to London, embodying much of what I had before
written, and giving a brief description of my treatment
at the General&#8217;s hands. I urged at greater length and
with more insistence the desirability of steps being
taken immediately on the lines I had suggested, declaring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
that there was necessity for immediate action;
that I believed a complete change of front was contemplated
by General Kolfort; that the Foreign Office
must be prepared instantly with a successor to the
reigning Prince&mdash;otherwise a <i>coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat</i> would be carried
out, which I was convinced would result in Russia
being left the complete master of the position; and
that the one key to the situation would be found in
timing the Prince&#8217;s abdication with the finding of a
successor who would not be Russia&#8217;s tool. And I
declared strongly in favour of the Princess Christina.</p>

<p>As soon as I had finished it I sent for my servant
Markov, who had been away with me the previous
night, and explained to him that he was to carry it to
Nish, and place it in the hands of the British consul
there, and at the same time deliver a letter, which I
wrote to Lieutenant Spernow. This note was to tell
him to destroy the first despatch.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you leave Nish,&#8221; I added, explaining the
next step, &#8220;you will return to the frontier by train,
and from there to Sofia you must organize relays of
horses at distances of from ten to twelve miles, avoiding
the main road where possible, so that at any
moment I can make sure of a quick, clear journey from
here to the frontier. Spare no money in the effort to
do the work well and quickly. You must have it complete
in four days at the outside, three if possible.
Choose your agents with great care, and give no hint
for whom the work is being done. If questions are
pressed, you can say it is in connection with a wager
between Russian officers. I trust you implicitly,
Markov,&#8221; I concluded. &#8220;And if you serve me well I
will give you such a reward as will make you independent
for life.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>He assured me earnestly of his attachment to me,
and said that, as he came from that part of the
country, he knew just the people who would do what
was needed. Then he added a characteristically Bulgarian
touch: &#8220;They know me well in those parts,
Count, and they hope that some day I shall settle
among them. I am looking forward to being able to
buy a small farm that I know of there, and marry.&#8221; I
took the hint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do this for me well, and I will buy the farm for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord is generosity itself!&#8221; cried the fellow, his
face radiant with glee, and I knew I could depend upon
a man of his kind when his personal feelings and self-interest
were running in double harness.</p>

<p>My object was, of course, to prepare the means of
flight should that become at any moment imperative;
and such a contingency grew more probable the more
closely I reflected upon what had passed at my interview
with the General. And I explained my views to
Zoiloff, who came hurrying to me on the receipt of
my letter, and told him what I had done.</p>

<p>The Russian officer, Captain Wolasky, dined with
me, and we spent an hour together in the shooting
gallery. I did my utmost to create a favourable impression
upon him, and appeared to be very successful;
for he expressed a warm wish that we might see
more of one another, and we parted on particularly
friendly terms. I was careful, of course, to avoid any
reference to political matters; but he himself let fall
enough to show me that his work in Sofia was exceedingly
distasteful, and that he had little sympathy with
Kolfort&#8217;s policy, and none at all with his methods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Russia must, of course, dominate the Balkans;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
that is the law of Nature,&#8221; he said once; &#8220;but I detest
a roundabout way of going to a mark when a straight
road could be cut with ease. That&#8217;s old Kolfort&#8217;s way,
however. He&#8217;s just like a man grubbing in a cellar for
coals, and will insist on having every little bit of rubbish
through his fingers and storing and binning it for
future use, as if he expected the day to come when
rubbish would be worth more than coal, whereas one
vigorous use of the shovel would give him all the coal
he wants at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was far from displeased to find him out of conceit
with the General, but said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What could have been more abominable and disgusting
than his treatment of you to-day?&#8221; he exclaimed,
when my wine had begun to heat him. &#8220;It&#8217;s
that sort of barbarism that brings us Russians into
such ill-repute. I know what would have happened.
He would have given that order to shoot you without
turning a hair and then would have drawn up some
bogus report or other about you having made a desperate
attack upon his life, and have called upon me
to witness it. I suppose he hates you for some reason,
and that&#8217;s at the bottom of it. There are plenty of
black pages in his past, I can tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better not,&#8221; I answered, smiling. I did
not wish him to have the after-reflection that he had
been talking too freely. If he were inclined to give
me his confidence he should not lack opportunities;
and I pressed him warmly, therefore, to come and see
me frequently.</p>

<p>He came the next day when Zoiloff was with me,
and again on the following day, when Spernow had returned,
and we encouraged his intimacy in every possible
way. Zoiloff, in the meantime, had made guarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
inquiries about him, having at first been disposed to
distrust him as a possible spy acting in General Kolfort&#8217;s
interest. He had found out that he was as genuine
as he seemed&mdash;a man with no family influence to
push his interests, of no means of his own, and constantly
standing in his own light because of his
scruples, and a blunt, rugged way of expressing them.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man not to be bought, but to be won,&#8221; declared
Zoiloff. &#8220;And, once won, to be trusted. He may be
valuable to us;&#8221; and so indeed the event proved.</p>

<p>On the occasion of his fourth visit I noticed that he
was reserved and seemed preoccupied, and while we
were all going through our practice in the gallery he
joined in it with small zest. We three were even
more jubilant than usual. We had been pushing forward
our preparations with the greatest energy and
activity, and Zoiloff had declared to me his belief that
in another ten days or a fortnight we might venture to
make the <i>coup</i> towards which all our efforts were bent.
Men had been sounded in all directions, and fresh adherents
had come in in large numbers, and with great
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I myself had not seen the Princess since the memorable
interview at the General&#8217;s house; but she knew of
all that we were doing. The marriage had been rendered
impossible for the moment because the Duke&#8217;s
wound had taken a turn for the worse, and he lay battling
almost for life. We had had no hint that our
suspicions of a change of front on Kolfort&#8217;s part had
any foundation; and our hopes ran high therefore that,
after all, we should yet carry things through with a
dash.</p>

<p>When our fencing was over, I observed that Captain
Wolasky hung about as if waiting for Zoiloff and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
Spernow to go; and I dropped them a hint quietly
that they had better do so.</p>

<p>As soon as we were alone, the Captain said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid this may be my last visit, Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, I hope not. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not betray my confidence, I am sure. I
have received a hint that my coming here is not acceptable
to those in authority&mdash;to old Kolfort that means,
of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, I am genuinely sorry. It cuts short
what I hoped would be a pleasant friendship.&#8221; I spoke
in all sincerity, for I liked him. &#8220;But I can understand
your position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not all,&#8221; he added, and then hesitated and
paused. I waited anxiously. &#8220;Of course I ought not
to say anything to you, but you have been so exceedingly
friendly. You may have heard that strange developments
are on foot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I have heard nothing.&#8221; I began to take
alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, of course, precluded from telling you their
nature; but I should ill return your hospitality if I
were not to give you a word of warning. You may
prepare yourself for a startling change, likely to involve
very serious consequences to you personally&mdash;if
you remain in Sofia;&#8221; and his look said more than his
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean, I am in some danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very grave danger, Count, and not you only.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may not ask you whom you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am afraid not. But there is one person in
whom report says you take a deep interest. I beg
your pardon for even referring to such a matter. But
the danger is very grave and&mdash;well, the frontier is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
near, and not yet closed. I can say no more, and, indeed,
I am sure I need not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have acted the part of a true friend, Captain.
How long will the frontier be open? May I ask
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am expecting orders at any moment to
guard a certain line of it, and the cordon will be very
securely drawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was news indeed, and for long after he had left
me I sat brooding over it deep in thought. I was right
after all, it seemed; and the cunning old Russian
spider had woven a fresh web.</p>

<small>FIGHT OR FLIGHT?</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the following day came startling confirmation
of Captain Wolasky&#8217;s warning. While I was with the
regiment a letter was brought to me from the Prince
requesting me to wait upon him.</p>

<p>I found him labouring under considerable excitement,
pacing the floor restlessly and awaiting me impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were never coming, Count,&#8221; he said,
irritably. &#8220;There seems to be no one now on whom
I can rely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came the instant I received your command, your
Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there must have been some strange delay in
giving my message. I cannot understand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything in which I can serve you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to Heaven you could get me out of this
wretched kingdom honourably. That would serve
me.&#8221; The words burst from him in obedience to an
irresistible impulse. &#8220;I am sick and weary to death
of it all;&#8221; and he continued his restless pacing for
three lengths of the room. He stopped abruptly and
threw himself into a chair close to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit here,&#8221; he cried, pointing to the chair next him.
&#8220;I want to speak frankly to you.&#8221; He paused again,
and then laying his hand on my arm said very earnestly:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
&#8220;My friend, you are playing a deadly game&mdash;and,
mark me, you are going to be defeated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness means&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; I asked steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;That your ideal is magnificent and worthy of you,
full worthy of any Englishman&mdash;but impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am flattered to hear such words from you,&#8221; I
replied cautiously, but he caught me up and answered
sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, Count, don&#8217;t answer me with
any courtly phrasings that come tripping off the lips
and mean nothing when spoken. I don&#8217;t ask you for
your confidence, unless you care to give it to me. I&#8217;ll
tell you what I know about you first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Countess Bokara has no doubt&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course she has; she has told me all she
knows, or guesses, or suspects, or whatever it may be.
But while it was only what she said I did not think of
seeing you or interfering with you. But I have learnt
it now from another source&mdash;one vastly more important.
And that&#8217;s what I mean when I tell you that
you are steering straight for the rocks and are dead
certain to be shipwrecked. Listen to me. You are
in love with the Princess, and naturally enough people
credit you with the intention of trying to climb into
the throne by&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is monstrous,&#8221; I cried, unable to keep silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope your repudiation comes from your heart&mdash;I
hope it for your own sake; for there is no happiness
under such a crown as I wear, Count Benderoff,&#8221; said
the Prince bitterly. &#8220;Men think of the dazzle, the
pomp, and the grandeur, the magnificence, and forget
the dangers, the cares, the awful loneliness. If you
seek happiness, seek it not in the glitter of a king&#8217;s
garb, but in the frank enjoyment of true manliness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
A monarch has mighty opportunities of making others
happy, but himself is doomed to sorrow and solitude.
There is no solitude that this life can know half so
awful in its depression as that which hedges a king.
You seek advice, you find intrigue; you hunger for
the truth, and they feed you with the bitter apples of
flattery; you yearn for the sweet counsel of a friend,
and you meet the tempered phrasings of a courtier.
Your every word is weighed in the balance of your
hearer&#8217;s self-interest, your every thought is caught
still-born and distorted, your every action is judged
by the sordid standard of some intrigue, and every
motive twisted and dissected, and analysed and maligned,
till your very face becomes a mask to hide your
mind, lest your enemies should use your looks to help
the plans which their malice is spreading under your
very eyes. God, it is unbearable.&#8221;</p>

<p>I listened in silence to this outburst.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wonder why I speak like this to you. I can
read it in your eyes&mdash;for am I not trained to find the
truth in the face and hear the lies in the voice? Well,
I would warn you, and more, I would warn that good,
true, noble woman whom you love. Time was when
I hated her, and believed all the harm that was said of
her; but now that I have learnt her real object&mdash;to
act, not with, but against, the bloodsuckers who seek
to devour the land&mdash;I know her goodness and sincerity.
But the movement must fail. The Russians know of
it, General Kolfort best of all, and he has already taken
his measures to thwart you all. And you will find his
hand a heavy one, Count. If the Princess Christina
had succeeded in gaining the throne on her own terms&mdash;I
mean by means of the men you and those with you
were seeking to train as her adherents&mdash;she must still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
have failed in her object, and have doomed herself to
a lot as miserable and hopeless as mine has been. But
Kolfort does not mean her to succeed; and, I warn
you, the measures of prevention will be sharp, sudden,
and terrible in their severity.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat amazed and disconcerted at his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wonder how I know all this, and set it down
to the Countess Bokara. Of course, she has told me;
but I have my news straight from General Kolfort
himself. You little know Bulgaria or the Bulgarians,
or you would have seen the consummate hopelessness
of trying to avoid treachery. Every man you have
added to your band has been a fresh centre of probable
treachery. The rule here is each man for himself; and
some one of the men with you was bound to ask himself
in time whether he could not gain more for himself
by carrying the news to the Russians than by
standing true to a desperate cause like your Princess&#8217;s.
Someone has betrayed you; and the betrayal began
when your love was known. They do not believe in
disinterested love in this country, Count. The peasants
may, but no one else. And when that secret
leaked out, General Kolfort&#8217;s task of suborning a
traitor became easy enough. If I knew the scoundrel&#8217;s
name I would give it you, that you might cut
his heart and tongue out for his cowardice. But, believe
me, everything is known&mdash;everything. And your
knowledge of that grim Russian leader may tell you
what to expect.&#8221; He spoke with all the earnestness
of a troubled friend; and I could not doubt him.</p>

<p>&#8220;When did your Highness learn this?&#8221; I asked
after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday. Three days ago, the General came to
me with proposals that showed he had some fresh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
plans in mind. He was all for my remaining here as
reigning Prince, and offered to concede more than half
the conditions of freedom of action I had before demanded.
It was a pity to disturb the country by a
change of rulers; the country was thriving under my
wise rule; the people were growing more contented,
and the malcontents could be overawed; the advantages
of my rule were appreciated in St. Petersburg,
and the basis of achieving mutual ends might probably
be arranged with honour to me and substantial
benefit to the country; and so on for an hour or more
he prated. I asked the reason for the change of tone,
and he hummed and hesitated, and, in a word, lied. I
said I must have time to think; and he gave me till
yesterday. Last night he came with his tale prepared&mdash;that
the Princess was conspiring for an end hostile
to both my aims and those of Russia; that you were
her right hand and had been set on by her to fight and
kill the Duke Sergius, but had succeeded only in wounding
him; that your plot was to use the Russian influence
to gain the throne and then yourself marry her
and reign as her consort; and to gain this end you
were both prepared to throw the country into the
throes of a civil war which God forfend, and so on, till
I was sick to death of his intriguing slanders. I tried
to lure him on to tell me what he proposed for you,
but he contented himself with saying he had all but
completed what I might rely upon would be effectual
measures of precaution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I venture to ask how your Highness answered
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I answer him but as I have always
answered? That I would never bend the knee to
Russia; that I did not believe St. Petersburg would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
ever sanction any such arrangement as he outlined;
and that if what he stated of the objects of the Princess
were true, I would be the first to abdicate in her
favour and join with her in her efforts, shouldering a
musket if need be, in the ranks of the men to fight for
her; and that would I, Count, if I saw the faintest
gleam of a hope of success. But there is not a chance,
no jot or tittle of hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that we have been betrayed, that is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before the betrayal the chances were not one in a
hundred; now they are not one in a million. There is
but one course for you and for her&mdash;flight, and at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will not desert the men who have stood by her.
Nor shall I,&#8221; I answered firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you will. The Russian preparations are all but
complete; Russian troops are being hurried to the
Black Sea; the slightest sign or movement on your
part will be seized on as the pretext for measures as
drastic as Russian measures commonly are; and you
yourselves, you two in particular and all associated as
leaders with you, will be treated you can guess how.
Russia knows how to treat her friends badly enough;
but no one ever yet accused her of not dealing effectively
with her enemies. You have been blind, Count;
but then a man in love is seldom anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was useless to pretend that I was not vastly
affected by what the Prince told me. I read in it ruin
and worse than ruin to everything, and my heart sank
at the prospect before Christina.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your warnings, and more, the kindly motives that
have prompted them, have moved me deeply, your
Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They had better move you out of Bulgaria. But
that is your personal affair. I have told you, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
of the service you rendered to one who is now, I regret,
your enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness knows of the attempt on the Princess
Christina&#8217;s life,&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;To my shame and sorrow, I do. She must not
think that I would have countenanced such a thing for
a moment,&#8221; he said in tone of deep pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;She does not,&#8221; I assured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you thwarted it is another service you have
rendered me, which adds to my eagerness to help you
both to safety. But even on the throne here I am
powerless to help my friends. Ay, and even my friends
are driven to inflict deeper wounds upon me than my
enemies.&#8221; His manner was that of a weak, hopeless,
dejected, sorrow-broken man. &#8220;You have spoken of
that deed, and I will tell you. Since I knew of it, I
have refused to see the Countess. I cannot see her
again; and I learn that in the mad hope of helping my
fallen cause she has been in communication with Kolfort,
leading him to think that I could be induced to
remain here. And I declare to you, Count, I do not
pass an hour, day or night, that is not care-ridden by
the fear of some yet more desperate deed she may
attempt&mdash;the consequences of which must fall on my
head. Every step she takes adds to either my danger
or my disrepute. And I can do nothing.&#8221; He wrung
his hands in weak unavailing despair.</p>

<p>I rose to leave; and, looking up half-eagerly, he
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;And will the British Government do nothing?&#8221;
The question was so absolutely inconsequential, and
suggested motives behind it so utterly at variance with
his attitude and words, that I was surprised. At one
moment he was declaiming against the miseries of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
position, and yet now he was clinging to the throne,
like a drowning man to a spar, with a vague reasonless
hope that even England would risk a war with Russia
to maintain him upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not the remotest right to say a word on that
matter, your Highness; but personally I do not think
for a moment that any interference can be looked for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then all is indeed lost!&#8221; he exclaimed, throwing
up his hands, and sighing heavily. &#8220;Farewell, Count,
let it be farewell; and do your utmost to snatch that
brave girl you love from the ruin that threatens to
overwhelm her.&#8221;</p>

<p>I needed no words of his to spur me to such an effort,
and as soon as I left the Palace, in grievous trouble
at all that I had heard, I sent a message for Zoiloff to
come to me at once, and hurried home to try and strike
out some line of action to meet this most dire emergency.</p>

<p>My impulse was to fight&mdash;to strike our blow without
a day&#8217;s delay; to take the Prince at his word&mdash;if he
had meant it; to get him to abdicate on the very next
day, and have the Princess proclaimed ruler in his
stead. Our preparations were not ready, and the <i>coup</i>
would be much less effective than if we could have had
time to complete everything. But then neither was
General Kolfort. He had not openly abandoned
Christina&#8217;s cause, and might be half afraid to oppose
her, if once on the throne, and without the aid of the
troops which the Prince had told me were being hurried
up to his support. For him to cause a civil war
was to take a step in the face of Europe which might
cost him dear, and force the other Powers to interfere&mdash;the
one step that Russia dreaded.</p>

<p>Unprepared as we were, and much as we had to gain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
by a few days&#8217; delay, Kolfort had much more to gain.
When once his grip had tightened in the way he projected,
there would not remain a vestige of hope for
us. Clearly, then, if we meant to fight, we must do
it at once.</p>

<p>It must be fight or flight.</p>

<p>In regard to the latter, I found Markov had returned,
and he assured me he had carried out my plans to the
letter&mdash;had even improved upon them, for he had told
me he had arranged for the last stage of the journey
to be by a very slightly known route to the frontier.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did this,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;because I heard rumours
of certain changes as to the guardianship of the frontier
roads, and I thought it well to choose the route which
would be the least difficult in case of trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done well, Markov, and have earned your
reward,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will let me stay with you to the last, my
Lord?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish it above all things, for I need faithful men
about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Zoiloff came I explained my views, putting
bluntly the alternative of fight or flight, and he was all
for fighting. But he shook his head gloomily at the
chances.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have left to the last the most hazardous work
of all,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and yet in some respects the most
important. I mean the winning over of some of those
men, the politicians, the men of tongues not deeds,
whose names are most before the public. They are
the most dangerous of all to meddle with, and yet
without them I fear for the result. And we cannot
draw them to us until we can show that the army is
on our side.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>&#8220;And what of the army?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have done all that human effort could achieve
in the time&mdash;but we could not do impossibilities. On
the troops in Philippopoli I believe we can count
surely. General Montkouroff is Bulgarian to the
core, and where he leads the majors will follow. He
has been sounded and will act with us. But here in
Sofia there is not a regiment, except that to which I
and Spernow belong, which would not turn against us.
This disposition of the troops has all been arranged
by Russia and the traitors who are Russia&#8217;s friends.
The risk is tremendous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no alternative but flight, remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And fly I will not. Come what may, we will
strike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the Princess will,&#8221; said I. &#8220;We must see her
at once.&#8221; And in this mood we started for her house,
Zoiloff urging me on the way to see her alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have more influence with her than all of us
put together,&#8221; he said quickly. &#8220;I will remain at hand,
and you can call me in if you cannot prevail. But you
are right, Count, and I am with you hand and heart.
We must either strike an imperfect blow at once or
abandon everything.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>THE HOUR OF INDECISION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> anticipations of the interview with Christina
were a mingling of pleasure and apprehension. I was
longing to see her. I had not set eyes on her for four
days, and, busily as the time had been filled, my
thoughts had been constantly with her. I recalled,
too, with a feeling of mixed tenderness and pain, how
she had then said we must not meet again alone,
and at the recollection my pulses thrilled again with
the sad sweetness of our acknowledged but never to be
avowed love.</p>

<p>The knowledge of her present danger moved me
deeply. I had to tell her the ill news myself, and, in
telling it, to urge her to take the course which I knew
must put an impassable gulf between us. It had been
easy enough for me, in consultation with Zoiloff, when
we were both staggered by this new development, to
decide for the counsel of energy and to choose the
course which, while loyal to Christina, my Princess,
was traitor to Christina, my love. But if she would
fly the country, there would be no longer the barrier of
a throne between us.</p>

<p>And in the minutes I was alone waiting for her coming,
the thought of all I was to lose in losing her, and
of all I was to gain if she would consent to flight,
threatened to make a coward of me and urged me to
plead with all a lover&#8217;s strength that she should choose
the course which would make her my wife. Away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
from her I could be the impassionate adviser, but in her
presence, with the light of her eyes upon my face, with
my heart glowing and throbbing with the knowledge
of my love for her and hers for me, it would be hard
to be more than a lover, and, being that, not to set
the hopes and desires of our love beyond all other
consideration.</p>

<p>I had to wait some minutes for her; and, as they
passed, the struggle grew fiercer, the temptation
strengthened, and the fear of losing her waxed until I
was almost impelled to call in Zoiloff to prop my
stumbling resolve. There were so many arguments to
favour flight. The road was still open; the means
were instantly available; safety could be won in a few
hours&mdash;long before this Russian tyrant could strike;
the Prince had counselled, even urged it; the Russian
captain had done the same; all were convinced that
safety could lie in no other course.</p>

<p>And if we struck and failed, what outlook was there
but humiliation, ill-usage, a prison, and possibly death?
Love was calling to us both on that frontier road, and
smiling with the promise of a life of rare delight; and
here in the city stood the gaunt shadow of menacing
defeat, with all its grim terrors and gloomy threats of
ruthless indignity, and quenchless, loveless sorrow and
separation. Is it to be wondered at that I hearkened
for the moment to the whispering invitation of love,
and closed my ears to aught beside?</p>

<p>But before she came I had fought it back, thrusting
the temptation away from me as a thing dishonourable
and unclean, and I rose to greet her with a heart as full
of loyalty as of love. She was looking sad and
troubled, and she bowed to me merely, not giving me
her hand as on former visits.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>&#8220;I had not thought that we should be alone again,
Count Benderoff,&#8221; she said, a little formally; and I
hoped I could detect in this reception and in the light
of her eyes when they fell upon me the sight of a personal
feeling of pleasure that needed to be held firmly
in check. I adopted a tone of formality that equalled
her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not forgotten your wish, Princess, but I have
been compelled by grave circumstances to come to you
thus. Have you heard any news? Your anxious
looks suggest that you may know what I have to
tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard nothing. Is there bad news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I grieve to say it is of the worst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This time, at least, you are the bearer of it,&#8221; she
replied, smiling faintly. &#8220;And I can trust you to tell
me frankly. What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I told her plainly everything. First, the warning
which the Russian officer, Captain Wolasky, had given
me on the previous evening; and his strong advice that
she should fly before it was too late. Then, in great
detail, all that had passed between the Prince and
myself that morning.</p>

<p>She was very pale and much agitated as my narrative
proceeded; but she interrupted me scarcely once,
and at the close sank back in her seat, and with her
hands across her eyes remained buried in thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hard news to hear,&#8221; she said despondently.
&#8220;You say it spells the ruin of everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is to the full as hard for me to tell as for you
to hear,&#8221; I answered gently. &#8220;But it is no moment to
flinch from the facts, however ugly. I fear it means
the ruin of everything.&#8221; At my gloomy words she
shuddered, and sat for some minutes silent in dismay.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
When she turned her face to me, it was so full of anguish
and pain that it made my heart ache.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I save those whom I have involved in
this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are thinking of you, Princess,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, no, not of me!&#8221; she exclaimed vehemently.
&#8220;For myself I care nothing. Heaven knows, my
motives have not been inspired by mere personal ambition.
I do not crave a throne, but I have longed
with a passion I cannot perhaps make you feel, to
spread the blessing of freedom among the people. For
this end I have striven; and now it seems I have failed.
Do not think of me. I will not think of myself. But
to bring others to ruin is more than I can endure. Tell
me&mdash;what do you advise? What can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There seem but two courses open,&#8221; I said, and
told her what Zoiloff and I had agreed together.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not think that I would fly and leave those
who have rallied to my cause to bear the brunt while I
was seeking the coward&#8217;s refuge of safety?&#8221; she asked,
half indignant that I should even have suggested it.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I did not,&#8221; I answered quietly; &#8220;I knew you;&#8221;
and her eyes thanked me for the words. &#8220;I should
remind you, too, that this check has come so suddenly
and prematurely for our plans that there are very few
who are really involved in any danger. We have
barely had time to throw off the veil of Russia&#8217;s sanction
of our efforts, so that there are scarcely more than
a handful of us who know the real object of the scheme;
and General Kolfort would be unable to bring home
even to them any acts against Russia. It is he who
has encouraged the plans laid &#8216;In the Name of a
Woman,&#8217; and his own writing was in evidence to prove
it. You will remember my early insistence upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
necessity for obtaining his written sanction. In the
face of that I do not see that he could produce proofs
to convict anyone except our trusty Zoiloff and Spernow,
and say two or three others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But yourself?&#8221; she cried, in a tone of quick alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not regard the consequences to myself as very
serious, Princess,&#8221; I said calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not run away,&#8221; she said, taking what I
said as an argument in favour of her seeking her own
safety, and she paused again to think. &#8220;Could I go
myself to General Kolfort; give up everything on condition
of his visiting it all on me? I am responsible.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a true woman&#8217;s offer, and a noble one; but I
shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear it would be hopeless. He would but drag
from you all that you could tell him, and then use the
information remorselessly and without a scruple against
those implicated. You would do the very thing you
seek to avoid.&#8221; Her face fell as she saw the truth of
this, and she sighed heavily.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this alternative&mdash;what is it but a wild forlorn
hope? A desperate step with scarce a chance of success?
May not the consequences be a thousandfold
worse than the worst that can come of doing nothing?
Have you thought of what would happen
if we failed? You said just now that so far only a few
are openly embroiled; but should we not be forcing
each man to declare himself, and would not each be
marked out plainly as a target for Russian malice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the hope of success, even if it be forlorn.
There are many of us who think it better to fight and
fail than not to fight at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not like it; I am afraid of it. The chances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
are so few; the risks so enormous to others. I dare
not sanction it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are men; the cause is a noble one; enthusiasm
has spread everywhere, and a lesser spirit has ere now
led a feebler movement to success. There is not one
of us, I believe, who would stand back in fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be bloodshed,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much blood has already been shed in the cause of
oppression. We must think of the ends, not the
means. A bold stroke here will bring the army in the
south to your standard&mdash;and that may do everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a momentous decision to have to make. I
cannot make it. I must have time to think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every hour that delays the decision may turn the
balance between success and failure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I thought we could triumph!&#8221; she cried, her
eyes flashing and her cheeks glowing for a moment.
But she paused, the light died out as quickly as it
had come, and she shook her head mournfully. &#8220;I
must have time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me send for Captain Zoiloff. Hear him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he can persuade me where you fail,
Count?&#8221; she asked, her eyes burning again, but with
a different emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least I would have you hear him, Princess,&#8221; I
said, dropping my eyes and speaking as evenly as I
could command my voice.</p>

<p>While he was sent for I stood in silence, and when
he came I told him briefly what had passed. He spoke
strongly and bluntly like the sturdy fellow he was; but
he could not prevail any more than I, and he left the
room rather abruptly.</p>

<p>The Princess looked after him with an expression of
the deepest pain, and when she turned again to me I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
saw the tears standing in her eyes, and her voice was
all unsteady as she cried from her heart:</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he think I would not do this if I dared?&#8221;
And throwing herself back in her seat, she pressed her
hands to her face, quite overcome with the strain of
her emotions.</p>

<p>I waited in much embarrassment, uncertain whether
to go or stay. Some moments passed in this tense
silence, and then, to my surprise, she turned upon me
with some indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you bring him here to humiliate me like
this? Does it give you pleasure to stay and witness
my weakness&mdash;or what you deem weakness? Cannot
you understand what I feel? Is everything to yield
place to ambition, and are the dictates of humanity
nothing to you? Cannot you see what I am suffering,
torn in this way by the distracting doubts of such a
crisis? Do you think these tears are not as hard for
me to shed as the blood of others as innocent of wrong
as God knows I am? Why do you plague me until
I&mdash;&mdash; Oh, forgive me my wild words! I don&#8217;t know
what I am saying.&#8221; And she passed in a breath from
indignation to lament.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to leave you now, Princess,&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you also leave me in anger? Have I no
friend staunch enough to bear with my moods, or true
enough to understand me? Yes, Count Benderoff, if
you wish to go the way is open to you.&#8221; And, rising,
she stood erect and proud, and made me a stately bow
as of dismissal. &#8220;I can decide and act alone, if need
be.&#8221; Yet in the very moment of her passing indignation
her lip quivered and her breath was tremulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;As God is my judge, I have no thought but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
you!&#8221; I cried, with a rush of passion at the sight of
her trouble, and I threw myself on my knee before
her. &#8220;Tell me how you wish me to act, and when I
have failed reproach me with want of staunchness, but
not till then.&#8221;</p>

<p>My voice was hoarse and broken.</p>

<p>As I knelt I could hear the quick catches in her
breath as she stood over me, and the very rustling of
the trembling laces of her dress seemed to speak to
me of her sufferings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have wronged you, or worse&mdash;I have insulted
you, Count. Ah me! I who know so well how you
are indeed my friend! Do not kneel to me. It is I
who should kneel to you.&#8221; And at that her hand,
fevered and trembling, was laid gently in mine, as if to
raise me to my feet.</p>

<p>I kissed the fingers, the tender grace of her words of
contrition almost unmanning me, and driving out all
thought but of my love and my desire to comfort her.
I rose, and, still holding her hand, gazed into her eyes,
which shone on me through the dew of her tears in a
smile of loving confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust you wholly,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Help me to
do right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were thinking of myself, I would urge you with
every means in my power to fly,&#8221; I said in low, rapid
accents of passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, you must not counsel that,&#8221; she cried
vehemently. &#8220;We must not, dare not, think of ourselves.
Spare me that temptation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot stay here and be safe unless we make
this desperate venture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the world would say I ran away because I
feared for my safety, betraying all who have sought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
to help my cause; or else that I fled to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She
paused, her face aflame with sudden blushes. &#8220;You
would not have me do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are my world,&#8221; I answered recklessly. &#8220;Listen
one moment. In our hearts we all know, Zoiloff as
well as any, that the cause is lost. Till I fired him
again&mdash;knowing how you would shrink from flight&mdash;he
was saturated with hopelessness. When he heard
the ill news, his one thought was how you could be
saved. That is the thought of us all. The way to
the frontier is still open. I have ready at instant command
the means of securing your safety. If you will
go, I will stay to check the slanderous tongues whose
malice you dread. If you bid me I will never see you
again. But for God&#8217;s sake, I implore you, leave me at
least the solace that you are safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words moved her so that for a while she could
not speak, but the clasp of her hand tightened on
mine. Then she asked tenderly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think the woman in me would know a
moment&#8217;s happiness if you were in danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let it be a woman&#8217;s decision,&#8221; I urged passionately,
carried away by the love in her voice. &#8220;Life
is all before us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It cannot be. Cannot. Must not,&#8221; and she
shook her head and shuddered. &#8220;You know what this
temptation must be to me. Do not urge it. I cannot
listen. I dare not yield. I beg you be merciful,&#8221; she
pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then fly and let me remain,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess cannot and must not go.&#8221; The words
came all reluctantly, but were firmly spoken. I saw
my pleading of love was to fail, and my heart sank.
&#8220;But you must fly!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>&#8220;Christina!&#8221; The name slipped in protest from
my lips before I thought, and I feared she would resent
it; and I felt her hand start.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the hardest plea of all you have used,&#8221; she
said softly, with a smile of rare sweetness. &#8220;Christina
is powerless to resist you, but the Princess must decide
this. Do not use that plea again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must&mdash;I cannot lose you,&#8221; I cried desperately,
&#8220;I love you so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, please, please don&#8217;t. If I dared to think of
myself there would be no gladlier fugitive under
Heaven&#8217;s bright sky than Christina. There, I have
bared my heart to you, as I never thought to open it.
And by the love I know you have for me, and by the
love that answers it in my heart, I entreat you help
me to be strong enough to resist you. Let us never
have to think that we placed our love before our duty&mdash;however
hard and stern. Lend me your man&#8217;s
strength; I need it so sorely.&#8221; And with a little
piteous action of entreaty she placed her other hand
on mine, and gazed full into my eyes.</p>

<p>I stood fighting down my wildly roused passion,
trembling under its stress like a child, till I conquered it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall be as you wish,&#8221; I said at length. &#8220;We
will stay and face this together. But you must not
ask me again to desert you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a higher happiness than is bounded by
our own wishes only,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can know no sorrow deeper than my loss of you.
But it shall be as my Princess desires;&#8221; and I bent
and kissed her hands again.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sorrow should be the lighter if divided,&#8221; she
whispered, with a tender reproach for the selfishness
of my words.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>&#8220;The thought made me a coward for the moment.
And no man should be a coward whose ears have been
blessed by the words which you have spoken, and the
knowledge I have gained. Forgive the cowardice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would I could as easily spare you the sorrow,&#8221;
she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;To do that now would be to rob my life of its one
great happiness. Come what may for me, I shall never
love again;&#8221; and with that assurance, which brought
all the love in her heart in a rush of eloquent, speaking
tenderness to her eyes, I left her, caring little indeed
what might happen to me if our union were impossible.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />


<small>IN FULL CRY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night that followed was a memorable one in
the history of Bulgaria and, as an incident of the great
event, it brought the crisis in our affairs.</p>

<p>It was the night in which by the machinations of
the Russian agents the Prince was abducted, and at
the point of the pistol was forced to sign an abdication
of his throne. It is not necessary for me to write
about an event which has been often enough described,
nor to tell how the crowd of unpatriotic and
disloyal officers led their troops to surround the Palace,
ordered them to fire into it, and then breaking in
forced his Highness to leave, and hurried him off to
Nikopolis, making him a prisoner on board his own
yacht, to be landed on Russian territory.</p>

<p>Exactly what led up to this crisis I do not know.
My opinion is that General Kolfort&#8217;s offer to maintain
him on the throne on certain relaxed conditions was
genuine and would have been fulfilled, but at the same
time the alternative plot was already in progress, and
this scheme was hastened forward on the Prince&#8217;s
refusal of the Russian terms.</p>

<p>Had our own preparations but been a couple of
weeks more forward the issue would have been different;
but, as it was, that <i>coup</i> set the final seal on
our failure.</p>

<p>The event took us absolutely by surprise. I had retired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
for the night wondering what the morrow would
bring forth, when my household were roused by a loud
summons at the door. My first thought was that the
General had again sent his men to arrest me; and I
was for resisting to the utmost, when it was discovered
that the summons came from Zoiloff and Spernow,
who had come in hot haste to bring me the great news
and to confer with me as to our actions.</p>

<p>The perilous nature of the crisis was obvious, and
my first thought was naturally for the Princess, with a
deep and bitter regret that she had not done what I
had urged so strongly&mdash;used the means we had to
make a dash for the frontier.</p>

<p>Choosing half-a-dozen of my servants on whom I
knew I could rely implicitly, we armed them fully and
set out on foot for the Princess&#8217;s house. The sounds
of firing from the direction of the Palace reached us
as we made our way through the streets, in which the
people were beginning to cluster in groups drawn by
curiosity and alarm, discussing in high and excited
tones the meaning of the disturbance.</p>

<p>No one stayed or questioned us on the way to the
Princess&#8217;s house, but when we reached it we halted in
amazement. Every window was dark, not a light
showing anywhere, while the gates and doors and forecourt
were thronged with armed men.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve captured her!&#8221; exclaimed Zoiloff, instantly.
&#8220;And we are helpless against such a crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must know the truth,&#8221; I said, my heart misgiving
me. &#8220;You are best known, Spernow; go forward
and try to ascertain the truth, whether the
Princess has been carried away, and if so, where.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went at once; and then Markov stepped up
to me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>&#8220;I think I can find out all. I am sure to know
some of the men,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>I sent him after Spernow, and stood back in the
shadow to wait with such patience as I could command.
My excitement and fear made me like a madman,
till I felt I could almost have rushed single-handed
against the troops and tried to hack my way
into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;This means devilish mischief, Count,&#8221; said Zoiloff
in a hushed tone. &#8220;You will be the next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I care nothing for myself, but I will save her,&#8221; I
said between my teeth.</p>

<p>Spernow came back in a few minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can learn nothing. The men have orders to hold
their tongues. But the Princess is not in the house;
at least I gather that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why the devil do they guard it?&#8221; cried Zoiloff
fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;They may be waiting for orders where to go next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be to your house, Count. You mustn&#8217;t
return there, but fly at once and leave us to settle
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I leave you either I shall be dead or the
Princess will be safe,&#8221; I answered hotly. &#8220;Let us
wait for Markov; he is a shrewd, cunning fellow, and
may find out something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am anxious about Mademoiselle Broumoff,
Count,&#8221; said Spernow, eager, as I could see, to get
tidings of her. I sympathised with him, as well may
be understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go in quest of her at once,&#8221; I said; &#8220;and, when
you can, return to my house, and we will thresh
out some plan of action. We may have news by
then.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>He was off like the wind, and Zoiloff and I waited
on in silence for Markov to return.</p>

<p>He seemed an age in coming, and I strained my eyes
in trying to catch some trace of him in the crowd of
moving figures that thronged the place. I gave a deep
sigh of relief when at length I saw him come out of
the gate, stand idly a moment glancing up and down
the street, and then, as if sauntering away in obedience
to the merest curiosity, cross the road to us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have news. We had better not stay longer here,
your honour,&#8221; he whispered, and walked away, speaking
rapidly as we walked. &#8220;The Princess Christina
left here some two hours ago. She is a prisoner in the
hands of General Kolfort&#8217;s men. She was roused by
them just before midnight and compelled to enter a
carriage that was in waiting, and was driven off under
a strong guard, with a considerable escort of mounted
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have they taken her?&#8221; cried Zoiloff and I,
in a breath together, when he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;The actual destination is not known, but the carriage
started for the south road, that leading to Liublian;
and one suggestion is that they will carry her
to Ichtman or on to Samakovo, where there is a strong
Russian detachment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know who was with her? Was anyone?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Mademoiselle Broumoff was taken from
home at the same time, and I believe was in the carriage
with the Princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear anything concerning the Count?&#8221;
asked Zoiloff.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was asked if your honour was still at liberty, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
advised to look out for a new master. I shall not do
that yet, sir, I hope,&#8221; he added; &#8220;not till you tell me,
at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>I liked his faithfulness in choosing such a moment
to assure me of his attachment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be a dangerous service for the next few
hours, Markov; but you have done excellently in this&mdash;excellently.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were now hastening back to my house, for I had
already resolved to follow on the Princess&#8217;s trail instantly;
to rescue her at any hazard, and hurry her
across the frontier, fighting our way, if need be, through
all who challenged us. Zoiloff was with me heart and
soul; and we set about the preparations with an
energy almost feverish in its earnestness.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had a large stud of first-rate horses,
and every man in the place who could be relied upon
was armed to the teeth and mounted, and provided with
enough rations to last through the coming day. I had
taken care to provide myself with a large sum in gold,
so as to be ready for any such emergency as the present,
and this I took with me. We numbered nearly
twenty men, all trained, vigorous, staunch fellows, and
all zealous to the heart&#8217;s-core in our cause.</p>

<p>When we were ready I took Zoiloff aside. I knew
his resolute character and his fidelity to the Princess;
but I knew also that his career lay in Bulgaria, and that
if he were caught with me on such an enterprise the
consequences to him would be worse than disastrous,
and I did not wish to embroil him any further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zoiloff, I am going to speak as a friend. No one
can see the end of this business of ours. We may find
ourselves face to face with the troops and may have to
risk an encounter with them. For me it does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
signify. I am an Englishman and can scramble out of
the mess somehow. For these men here there is no
great danger either. Old Kolfort won&#8217;t deal harshly
with servants who can plead that I forced them into
it. But with you it is all different. You are an officer,
and to fight against the troops is an act of deadly
treason&mdash;mutiny probably, punishable with Heaven
knows what penalties. Now, as my friend, will you
let me ask you to stay here and guard our interests in
Sofia?&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard me impatiently and looked at me keenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you serious, Count?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my friendship&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, please, or I may say something I should
regret, Count,&#8221; he broke in, bluntly. &#8220;I should not
reckon that man a friend who would urge me to be a
coward. Were you any other man I would not brook
it once, and even you will put a strain on our friendship
if you breathe a word of this again. We are
wasting time. Let us to horse. I have not deserved
this of you, Count, and if I thought I had I&#8217;d shoot
myself for a cur. Are you the only man that can love
the Princess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, friend. I beg your pardon,&#8221; I cried,
vastly moved by his words; and I held out my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no rival of yours,&#8221; he said earnestly, as he
wrung it. &#8220;But if a hair of her head be injured I will
know by whom, and if it does not go hard with him I
am no man. Come, I am hot to be away.&#8221;</p>

<p>As we were mounted, Spernow dashed up on horseback,
pale of face and wild of manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nathalie has gone, too,&#8221; he exclaimed, and I told
him very briefly what we believe had occurred.</p>

<p>In another minute we started, riding in couples and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
at some distance. Quietly, until we were clear of the
town, was the order I gave; then join, and forward in
full cry. The firing had not entirely ceased at the
Palace when we set out, and an occasional report
reached us as we wended our way through the city by
different streets to the point on the south road where
we were to join. So much was now astir in the city
that even our cavalcade caused little or no comment or
surprise. Strange tidings and rumours were now on the
wind, flying everywhere, and the excitement and confusion
they spread caused our movements to pass unchallenged.</p>

<p>Once at the meeting-place we pricked our horses
into a gallop and set out, a stern determined band dead
set on revenge, and resolved every man of us to achieve
the end we had at the cost of life itself.</p>

<p>I rode at the head, with Markov as guide; Zoiloff
and Spernow behind me, and the rest, four abreast,
keeping order like a small cavalry detachment. The
night was bright with moonlight, and the country lay
around us everywhere still and sunk in sleep. Scarce
a soul was astir in the hamlets through which our road
passed, but I took the utmost precaution to prevent
any mischance.</p>

<p>As we reached each village, I called a halt and sent
Markov forward to see that all was clear, for I half
expected that Kolfort would have foreseen our pursuit
of Christina and have posted men to stop us. To
save time we gave Markov three minutes; and if he
did not return or fire a shot to give an alarm, we clattered
after him at full gallop.</p>

<p>So long as it was night, there was no one of whom
we could make inquiries, and thus we were riding
somewhat at random; but as soon as the dawn should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
begin to streak the east I knew the peasants would
soon be astir, and that then we might pick up a trace
or two of those we were seeking.</p>

<p>Then Markov made a valuable suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will your honour let me ride on ahead some half
mile or so? We are nearing Liublian now, and if I am
alone I may get news which would be refused to so
large a body of us together. I may see any danger,
too, and be able to warn you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A prudent thought, Markov,&#8221; I said, bidding him
ride on. &#8220;If we see you riding back to us, or if we
hear you fire a shot, we shall draw rein and wait till
you join us;&#8221; and with that he plunged ahead at full
speed, and we watched him till he was out of sight
over a rise in the road.</p>

<p>I told Zoiloff the arrangement, and we were discussing
the situation in jerky whispers while we halted,
when one of my men came galloping up in great excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord, we are being pursued. I had to stay
behind to get a stone out of my horse&#8217;s hoof, when I
heard the sound of horses galloping some way behind
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far behind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot say&mdash;the night is very still. Perhaps
half a mile, or maybe a mile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ride on at once and overtake Markov, and warn
him to draw into cover. Off with you! We must
find out who the horsemen are and their strength,&#8221; I
added to Zoiloff.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a small wood there, which will do for
cover, Count,&#8221; he replied instantly. &#8220;Let the men
ride there and take our horses, while you and I stay
on foot to watch the newcomers.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>I told Spernow to post the men in the covert, and
Zoiloff and I lay down in some bushes to wait for the
pursuers.</p>

<p>It was an anxious moment, and we lay close together,
whispering in hurried conference. We had not long
to wait.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear them,&#8221; whispered Zoiloff, gripping my arm.
His ears were quicker than mine, but a moment later
I, too, caught the clatter of horses&#8217; feet and then the
clash of accoutrements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Troops,&#8221; I whispered; and we both peered between
the bushes, straining our ears, through the grey twilight
of the dawn.</p>

<p>As they reached the foot of the rise near the top of
which we were concealed the party slackened speed,
first to a trot and then to a walk, to ease the horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope to Heaven none of our horses neigh,&#8221;
whispered Zoiloff earnestly.</p>

<p>I made no reply. I was too anxious for speech, for
such a chance might ruin everything. I almost held
my breath as the first of the horsemen came into view,
and then my companion gripped my arm again in a
spasm of irresistible excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kolfort, by the luck of hell!&#8221; he breathed, and
sure enough, in the second line of three, I recognised
the grim, stern face of that implacable man.</p>

<p>So excited was I that I almost forgot to count the
men with him, and a thousand thoughts, wild and incoherent,
rushed through my mind as the band of
horsemen came up at a quick walking pace, got abreast,
then passed on up the rise, and dipped out of sight as
they broke again into a gallop, the footfalls of the
horses dying away very quickly over the summit of
the hill.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>&#8220;I hope to the Lord he&#8217;s going to the Princess!&#8221;
exclaimed Zoiloff as we scrambled to our feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;More likely he wants to be in a position to prove
his absence from the city when the Prince is being
carried off,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But wherever he&#8217;s going we
must know and follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>I ran across to where our men were posted and told
off one of them to follow hot on the heels of the party
and be ready to guide us, and I gave him enough start
of us to allow for our not being heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s clear he wasn&#8217;t following us,&#8221; said Zoiloff.
&#8220;There were only twelve men all told in the party.
What a chance we have missed! If we had only
known, we could have lined the road just where we
two lay, and they&#8217;d have walked right into the trap.
Only twelve to nearly twenty of us! and we should
have had him safe enough. God! If we could only
get hold of him, the safety of the Princess would be a
simple matter enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We may do it yet,&#8221; said I as I mounted, and we
set off again in pursuit of those we had believed to be
in pursuit of us.</p>

<small>THE ATTACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was true enough of course that we had missed
a glorious chance in not surprising and overcoming
General Kolfort&#8217;s party and making him a prisoner;
but with our end in view it would have been madness
to risk an encounter when we had absolutely no knowledge
of the strength opposed to us. A defeat at such
a moment would have overthrown all our plans and
have involved the abandonment of Christina to whatever
fate might be in store for her.</p>

<p>It was true, too, that in allowing the General to pass
and his men to get in touch with the others who were
guarding the Princess, we had increased our difficulties;
and the result of a hurried consultation with Zoiloff as
we rode forward was a decision to seek and overtake
the General&#8217;s party and try conclusions with them.</p>

<p>For this purpose, however, we had wasted valuable
time, and the now rapidly lightening dawn greatly
lessened the chance of catching them unawares, and
vastly increased the risk. But we were in no mood to
count the chances too gingerly and we dashed along
at as rapid a pace as our horses could travel.</p>

<p>The road was execrable&mdash;rough and uneven beyond
description, with large loose stones scattered about in
it in a way that made the going exceedingly difficult,
and in parts galloping was impossible.</p>

<p>We had ridden in this way about half an hour, constantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
having to draw rein for either the roughness of
the road or the steep hills, when we came up with the
man we had sent to warn Markov, and the other who
had been despatched to follow the General&#8217;s party.</p>

<p>Markov had undertaken the spy work in preference
to the man I had despatched, and the change was a
good one. I had not been free from the fear that
Markov might be surprised by the General, despite
our precaution in sending to warn him, and it was good
news that he was safe.</p>

<p>We did not stay our progress a moment. The men
rode by my side as each in turn gave me his report,
and then dropped back into the ranks behind as we
thundered forward, eager to overtake the General
before he should fall in with any other troops; and
the best news that the men brought us was that we
were gaining fast upon them, and that Kolfort was not
far ahead.</p>

<p>This spurred us to further effort, and we were rushing
on filled with the hope of catching him, when I
saw Markov in the distance galloping wildly in our
direction. I ordered a halt instantly, and drew up to
await him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tracked them, my lord,&#8221; he said hurriedly;
&#8220;but the news is bad. General Kolfort and his party
are in a house, about a mile ahead, that belongs to
him, and it is there the Princess Christina has been
carried. At least I judge so, for I slipped from my
horse and managed to find out that there were a number
of soldiers about; and I spied a travelling carriage
in front of the house with all the signs of a long
journey on it. The horses had been taken out, and I
judged it had just been left where it stopped, the
horses being taken to the stables. I saw General Kolfort&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
party halt there, and he and one or two with him
entered the house while the soldiers went round to the
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many soldiers in all?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;From what I heard in the city last night, I gathered
there were about a dozen in charge of the Princess;
I counted another dozen with General Kolfort&mdash;say
from twenty-five to thirty, all told, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can do it if we surprise them,&#8221; said I, turning
to Zoiloff. &#8220;Not so good a chance as we had just now,
but still a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Catch them while off their
guard and probably getting food after their ride;&#8221; and
in less than a minute we were moving forward again,
Markov riding on my left.</p>

<p>Just before we came in full view of the house, Zoiloff,
Spernow, and I rode forward to reconnoitre the ground
and plan the attack. The house lay well situated for
such an attempt. We were looking down on it from a
slight hill, and on three sides some fairly thick wood
and shrubbery shut it in, in which a couple of regiments
could have been posted had we had such a force
available. We could see three or four men in the front
of the house and in the road, left to do sentry work;
but they were lolling about chatting together, and obviously
thinking of nothing less than any such attack
in force as we meditated; and, had we dashed up the
road in a body, it was likely enough we could have
carried the place before any effective resistance could
have been offered.</p>

<p>But we formed a far different plan. Markov led us
along the ridge of the hill fringed with trees to a point
from which we could command a view of the rear of
the house, and then I observed something that gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
me an idea and made my heart leap with exultation.
Preparations were going forward quickly to give the
soldiers their breakfast, and I saw all the things being
carried from the house to a low building across a wide
yard that looked like a barn. The soldiers were
chaffing the women and helping to carry the food and
vessels; and in a moment my plan was ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall catch them like rats in a trap,&#8221; I cried to
Zoiloff, as I pointed this out to him. &#8220;The place is
made for us and couldn&#8217;t be better. We&#8217;ll time our
visit when the men are just at breakfast yonder, and,
if a couple of our fellows can steal up unseen, that big
door can be slammed, and there won&#8217;t be more than
half a dozen left for us to deal with about the house.
We shall cage the old fox to a certainty. Let Spernow
and two men creep along this way and down
under cover of those trees to the entrance to the
yard, and post themselves there. The main portion
can get to the house through the orchard below
us&#8221;&mdash;and I pointed to the spots I meant&mdash;&#8220;and we
shall be into the place before they even dream that we
are near. Once we get close to the house, do you and
half a dozen make for the front and settle with anyone
there, making an exit from the house impossible. I&#8217;ll
enter by the back with the rest of us and square accounts
with anyone inside. The horses must be left
up here in the woods, tethered; we can&#8217;t spare a man
to stay with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>We discussed the minor points of the attack, fixed
the moment, and left it that Spernow&#8217;s closing the
door upon the troops at breakfast should be the signal.
If things went wrong with him and the men
escaped, we settled that Zoiloff should, as arranged,
rush round to the front, but that I and the men with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
me should hasten to Spernow&#8217;s assistance and attack
the men there.</p>

<p>We went back to the rest of the party, led them all
into the wood on the hill from where we had made
our observations, had the horses fastened over the hill
and well out of sight of the house, and then, with arms
all ready, crept back to the edge of the wood to wait
for the moment to commence.</p>

<p>The movement and bustle of preparation were going
on briskly below; the maids and the men were hurrying
and scurrying in all directions, and there was such
stir and life that it threatened to be impossible for us
to creep down unseen.</p>

<p>Gradually there came a change. Things grew
quieter, and presently the servant girls went into the
house and did not return. We saw the soldiers,
laughing and joking, cross in couples and threes to the
barn; two of those who had been on guard in the
front came running round, rested their muskets against
the wall of the barn outside and joined their comrades
within; and the place was quiet and unguarded. I
gave the word to advance, and a moment later we
began to wend our way stealthily down the hill-side,
closing gradually on the house. Not a word was
spoken, and not a sound betrayed our presence. When
we reached the point where Spernow was to leave us
to get to the other end of the yard, I whispered to him
to take an extra man in case of emergencies, and then
at the head of my men I threaded my way up the side
of the orchard, with Zoiloff close in attendance.</p>

<p>All went well. We reached a low mud wall that
parted the orchard from the homestead yard, and halted
there until Spernow should give the signal by slamming-to
the great barn door. By peering through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
branches of some fruit trees I could see the spot where
he was to post himself. Just when all was about in
readiness, and he and his three men were standing at
the end of the barn, round the corner of it fortunately,
one of the soldiers came out, picked up one of the
muskets leaning against the wall, and stood a moment
laughing and chaffing with those within. He was one
of the sentries, and called to those within to be quick.
Then, whistling carelessly, he shouldered his weapon
and moved away.</p>

<p>Moments were growing precious now. Would Spernow
wait for the man to disappear round the front at
the risk that others of the soldiers would finish and
come out, or would he act while the man was in full
view and take the risk of a shot? He was in dire hesitation;
and I could see him peep round the corner of
the barn and peer anxiously after the man.</p>

<p>Then something seemed to decide him&mdash;he told me
afterwards he heard the men in the barn beginning to
move&mdash;and with quick, stealthy steps he and his men
rushed to the great door, slammed it to, and secured
it. The soldier was attracted by the noise, turned,
saw what had happened, raised an alarm, and was in
the act of firing at Spernow when one of the latter&#8217;s
men shot him and he fell to the ground.</p>

<p>At the same time Zoiloff called his followers and
dashed for the front of the house, while I, seeing that
all was well with Spernow, rushed to the back door.
It was slammed in my face, but a blow from our guns
smashed it in, and after a short delay we gained the
passage.</p>

<p>All the house was in wild alarm, and the soldiers in
it put themselves in my way, offering a stubborn resistance.
But we outnumbered them by three to one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
and after a scrimmage that was hot enough while it
lasted we overpowered them, struck their weapons from
their hands, bound them, and thrust them into a room
in the custody of a couple of men with strict orders to
shoot if any nonsense was attempted.</p>

<p>Our surprise was in that respect completely and
triumphantly successful, but in regard to one of the
chief objects it failed. The way which we had chosen
for Zoiloff to make his rush to the front of the house
was blocked by some outhouses which we had not
seen, and he and his men had had to return and run
round to the other side. The delay caused was not
long, but it was fatal, for the first thing he saw on
reaching there was General Kolfort in company with
a couple of attendants, presumably officers, spurring
at topmost speed in the direction of Samakovo. He
came rushing into the house, his face black in his deep
disappointment, and told me the ill news, just as we
had finished our scrimmage with the men inside.</p>

<p>I saw at once pursuit would be hopeless. I should
not have dared divide our little party even had there
been a good prospect of overtaking the fugitives, and
to send them on a wild-goose chase would have been
worse than madness; moreover, our horses were away
on the top of the hill, and already somewhat spent with
the fierce ride. But it took some moments to get
Zoiloff to see the uselessness of such an attempt&mdash;moments
that could ill be spared, seeing all that we
had yet to do. But I was firm, and he gave in at
length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take our men and secure those fellows in the barn,
or we shall have them breaking out. Find the best
horses you can, too, and have them into the carriage
as quickly as possible, and I will see the Princess and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
tell her to be ready at once. We dare not waste a
minute or all will be lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>I dashed up the stairs, and after searching a couple
of empty rooms found one with the door locked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you there, Princess? It is I, Count Benderoff,&#8221;
I cried, turning the key and partly opening the door.</p>

<p>She answered me and I entered. She was calm but
pale, with the little Broumoff at her side, very agitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have heard the noise, but could see nothing
from here, and have been filled with anxiety as to
what it meant. What has happened?&#8221; cried the
Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can say no more now than that when we heard
last night that you had been carried off we followed at
once, and happily are now in possession of the house;
but you must be ready to fly at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of General Kolfort? He came here only a
few minutes since and threatened me with all the terrors
of a Russian gaol. He was like a madman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most unluckily he has escaped us, and may return
at any moment in force. Will you get ready at once?
Our only hope is to make for the frontier before we
can be pursued.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready now,&#8221; she cried, throwing on her travelling
wraps. &#8220;Come, Nathalie, come, the Count has
saved us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was dressed almost as quickly as the Princess,
and together we went down to the front to wait
for the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you had anything to eat? We have a long
journey before us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not think of food.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a word, I got some milk and cakes and
bread, and put them in the carriage, to which Markov<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
was already harnessing horses. Then I described in
the fewest possible words what had happened, and
they both listened in breathless interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Michel?&#8221; asked Mademoiselle Broumoff
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is safe,&#8221; I answered, with a smile, &#8220;and has behaved
splendidly, like the magnificent fellow he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the carriage was ready I told Markov to
draw out into the road in readiness to start, and I ran
through to call off our men. Zoiloff met me excited,
hot, and breathing hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have secured them all right. I filed up the
men, and when we threw open the door the caged men
were met with a line of muskets. They had no fight
in them, for they had no arms. We have bound every
man, and to make pursuit impossible I have had every
horse in the stables shot. A cruel job, but necessary;
and I have brought away the men&#8217;s arms. We may
start, Count. Our men are already away for their
horses, and will meet us at that bend in the road
above.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said I; but I wished he had brought the
horses with us for remounts instead of shooting them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, yes; but much better if that wily old devil,
Kolfort, hadn&#8217;t slipped through my fingers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the route, Markov?&#8221; I said, going out to
him. &#8220;We dare not return to Sofia. How can you
reach the nearest point on the frontier road where we
can get fresh horses for the carriage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must go back to within three miles of the city,
sir, and then I can pick a way round and strike the
west road there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t keep on this road for a yard longer than is
absolutely necessary. It is dangerous. But do your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
best. Push on with all speed. We shall overtake
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I finished speaking Spernow came running from
the house and rushed to the carriage window. I let
the carriage stand half a minute that he might exchange
a word or two with Mademoiselle Broumoff,
who I knew was very eager to see him, and while they
were speaking the Princess looked out of the window,
beckoned Zoiloff, and gave him her hand and a word
of hearty thanks for all he had done in her behalf.</p>

<p>It was a thoughtful, gracious act, and I was as glad
as Zoiloff himself, who stood aside with a flush on his
stern face to let the carriage pass when I gave the
word to Markov to start.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fairest and best of all women on earth,&#8221; he
said, enthusiastically, as we three watched the carriage
dash up the hill that led from the house. &#8220;I hope to
heaven we shall get start enough to save her;&#8221; and
he glanced back anxiously along the road that Kolfort
had gone, as if he feared that pursuit might already be
on foot.</p>

<p>And the same fear infected us all as we followed his
gaze. But there was no sign of any pursuit; and we
hurried up the hill to the spot where the men were to
meet us with our horses.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />


<small>SUSPENSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> we three hurried up the hill we discussed earnestly
our plans; and the supreme seriousness of the
failure to secure the person of General Kolfort grew
more vividly forcible the more we considered it.</p>

<p>We could have held him a prisoner in his own house
easily and without creating any alarm at his disappearance.
And the Princess could have gained the frontier
before ever a question had been asked as to her whereabouts.
I gnashed my teeth as I thought of it.</p>

<p>Now, however, he would raise the alarm at the first
possible moment. He knew that we were in considerable
force, and not only could he send troops after us,
but by telegraph he could send instructions to have us
intercepted at any one of a dozen points.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does anyone know where the wires run from Ichtman
and Samakovo to Sofia?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;If we could
cut them, we might save some hours when even minutes
may be vital.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Why didn&#8217;t we think of it before?&#8221;
exclaimed Zoiloff. &#8220;I know them. They run along
the course of the projected railway. I can find them
inside an hour. The line is to touch Liublian, and
must run close here somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then take a couple of men as soon as we are
mounted and rattle off across country and cut them,
and rejoin us with all possible speed. You will easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
overtake the carriage;&#8221; and the moment we met our
men he started to carry out the plan.</p>

<p>I then arranged the order of our ride. I left Spernow
in command of the greater number of men, with
orders to follow in straggling formation until we had
passed through Liublian; then they were to close up
and keep the carriage in sight. One man was to ride
about a mile or so in the rear to watch for any signs
of pursuit. For this work I chose the man whose
horse was the fleetest and freshest, and ordered him to
keep a sharp lookout behind him, and at the first sign
of anything wrong to gallop after us at top speed to
give us the earliest possible warning.</p>

<p>I myself took three men with me and rode forward
at once, intending to overtake the Princess and act as
immediate escort.</p>

<p>I had little difficulty, unfortunately, in getting up
with the carriage, for Markov, with all his skill as
coachman, was only able to make a very indifferent
pace over the villainous roads. The carriage bumped
and rolled and jumped in the deep ruts and over the
stones in a way that filled me with alternate fear that
it was travelling too fast for the safety of the occupants,
and of despair that so slow a pace would make
pursuit an easy enough matter.</p>

<p>It was a great, heavy, lumbering, travelling coach,
built for the comfort of those who were content to
travel at an easy rate; and about as little suited for the
purpose of rapid flight as anything could be. I could
have cursed it, as it lumbered along groaning, creaking,
straining, threatening to topple over at every other
lurch, and distressing the horses, powerful though they
were, until the sweat lathered on their flanks and
dripped on the rough, cruel road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there a hope of getting any better carriage at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
Liublian?&#8221; I asked Markov, riding up to him as we
neared that place. &#8220;We shall never reach the frontier
in this thing; an open cart would be better. Try if
you can&#8217;t get something. Steal it if you can&#8217;t hire or
buy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The horses are nearly done already, your Honour,&#8221;
said Markov; &#8220;although we&#8217;ve only come some seven
miles. I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be quick,&#8221; I said, as I fell back behind
again.</p>

<p>Despite the very urgent need for haste, we entered
the place driving very leisurely, and drew up at the
inn, when Markov and I entered to make inquiries.
We were in luck. The man had a comparatively light
open cart for sale and a couple of strong young horses.
A few minutes found the bargain struck, and while my
men were refreshing themselves the horses were put
in, and Christina and her companion left the great ugly,
cumbersome carriage to take their places in the cart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could we get peasants&#8217; clothes?&#8221; suggested Mademoiselle
Broumoff. &#8220;Any kind of disguise might help
us.&#8221; It was a happy thought, and the ever resourceful
Markov acted on the hint directly, and procured
cloaks and headgear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better put them on when we are clear of the place,&#8221;
I decided, as Markov put the bundle into the cart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you will find the road to safety very
rough, Princess,&#8221; I said as I helped her into the cart.
I had not spoken to her since leaving the General&#8217;s
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am causing you all sore trouble,&#8221; she answered,
smiling sadly. &#8220;How shall I ever thank you enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have our reward when we see you safe in
Servia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I ought to have done what you advised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
yesterday and have gone then. All this would have
been spared us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could not foresee what old Kolfort had planned
for last night. I thought the road would have been as
open to-day as it was yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like you to lighten the blame, but it is my
fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are ready, your Honour,&#8221; called Markov.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward then,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Cautiously out of Liublian,
and then press on with all the speed you can
make.&#8221;</p>

<p>I mounted, and was in the act of starting when a
horseman was seen riding hard up the road we had
come. It was Zoiloff, and I welcomed him gladly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done it,&#8221; he said exultantly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
whether there are any other wires, but I&#8217;ve cut the
main ones, and that will probably cause some delay.
But how came you to halt here?&#8221; he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>I explained the change of vehicles, and we rode on
after the Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;You passed Spernow?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and left my men to follow with his. He tells
me he is to join you as soon as he is clear of Liublian;
he should be near now;&#8221; and he glanced back as I
thought with some anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have done well so far. It was a stroke of luck
to get rid of that lumbering old carriage,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;True, but we have already been a long time covering
very little ground, and must press forward. Our
pursuers won&#8217;t sleep on the road. I&#8217;m surprised we
haven&#8217;t heard from them before now.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was unlike him to meet alarm half-way in this
fashion, but I made no answer except to urge my horse
to greater speed, so as to close up the distance between
us and the Princess.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>Markov was now driving at a very rapid rate, the
road was much better, and I felt my spirits rise as we
covered the ground quickly. Every yard gained safely
made the prospect of escape more hopeful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spernow should have joined us by now,&#8221; said
Zoiloff again presently, as we were breathing the horses
up a steep hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been travelling much faster since we
changed conveyances, and his cattle may be a bit
stale,&#8221; I replied, trying to reassure him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid something&#8217;s going wrong with him. It&#8217;s
not like him to play the laggard in this way. Can he
have been overtaken by Kolfort&#8217;s men and surprised?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scarcely that. We&#8217;ve got a picket thrown out behind
and he&#8217;d have warning. If there was any sign of
danger, I told him to close up with us at once, so that
we could make a stand together. One or two of the
horses may have given out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; said Zoiloff; and when we reached
the top of the hill we turned and looked back along
the white road, searching eagerly for some sign of
Spernow&#8217;s coming. We saw nothing, and the doubts
which made Zoiloff&#8217;s face so grave began to affect me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am inclined to go back,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t spare you, Zoiloff,&#8221; said I quickly. &#8220;If
anything is wrong with him, you alone can do no good;
and if anything is to go wrong with us, we are too few
already for safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could find out what it means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or be cut off yourself;&#8221; and with that we resumed
our ride, my companion&#8217;s face unusually gloomy and
thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far are we from Sofia, Markov; and when
do you turn off?&#8221; I asked, riding up to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;About five miles from the city, your Honour, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
little more than two from the branch road I am making
for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve only a few minutes more on the main road,&#8221;
I said, falling back to Zoiloff; &#8220;and, once away from
it, our chances will be fifty in a hundred better. It&#8217;s
this road I&#8217;ve feared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Here comes news!&#8221; exclaimed my companion
suddenly, a few minutes afterwards, turning in his
saddle and looking back. &#8220;And bad news too,&#8221; he
added.</p>

<p>A single horseman was dashing down a hill behind
us, and as we turned a number of other horsemen
reached the crest and came streaming down the hill
after him, the sunlight glistening through the cloud of
white dust as it fell on their arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;That should be Spernow and our men,&#8221; said I
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Spernow, but they&#8217;re not our men. I feared
it meant mischief. They are troopers; and I can count
a dozen of them. Tell Markov to drive like the wind.
They&#8217;re after us.&#8221;</p>

<p>A bend in the road at that moment cut off our view,
and almost directly afterwards Markov turned away to
the left into a narrow lane, putting his horses to the
gallop.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have to fight for it, Count,&#8221; cried Zoiloff.
&#8220;There didn&#8217;t seem more than a dozen troopers that
I could see, and, with Spernow, we shall be six. We
can hold them at bay in this narrow lane, and perhaps
drive them off.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment a loud shout of dismay came from
Markov, and we saw him pull his horses up in a
scramble.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; I called, riding up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken the wrong lane, your Honour, cursed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
fool that I am,&#8221; he cried in sore distress. &#8220;I know it
now; there is no outlet. I should have driven on for
about five hundred yards farther;&#8221; and he backed his
horses as if to turn them.</p>

<p>It spelt absolute ruin.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no going back, Markov,&#8221; I said decisively.
I was calm enough now for all the trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil!&#8221; exclaimed Zoiloff. &#8220;Well, we must
make a fight of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay a moment. Where does this lane lead,
Markov?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To a peasant&#8217;s homestead, with no outlet anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward to that, then&mdash;at a gallop. We can hold
the house against the men with far better chances than
here,&#8221; I said to Zoiloff. &#8220;Besides, they may not have
seen us turn off the road, and may go on to the next
turning. But what of Spernow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was gaining on them fast, and will escape in
any event,&#8221; said Zoiloff; &#8220;but it&#8217;s a perilous fix.&#8221;</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later we halted in front of the
cottage, to the infinite surprise of the inmates. Markov
knew them however, and while he was explaining
things to them the rest of us set to work to put the
place in readiness to resist the expected attack.
Fortunately it lent itself well to the purpose; and,
long before the peasant owner had been pacified with
a good round sum of money, every door and window
was closed and barred, and the horses and cart had
been stabled close to the rear of the house in a shed,
the door of which we could easily command, so as to
prevent anyone trying to steal off with them.</p>

<p>The Princess and her companion were placed in an
upper room, well out of the danger of stray bullets;
and, though we were breathless with our exertions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
we were quite prepared to give our visitors a warm
reception before a sign of the soldiers or of Spernow
was visible.</p>

<p>Both Zoiloff and I kept an anxious lookout from a
window in the roof of the cottage which gave a view
of a considerable portion of the lane that led to the
homestead; but the minutes crept on until a quarter
of an hour, half an hour, an hour passed without a sign
or trace of either our friend or our enemies; and, indeed,
until we grew as anxious to see the former as to
know we had escaped from the latter.</p>

<p>What could it mean? Zoiloff and I exchanged many
an anxious question and hazarded many futile guesses.
I was inclined to hope that the soldiers had not seen
us after all, and that in our little hiding-place we had
not only escaped them, but had been overlooked by
any other parties that might have been despatched in
search of us.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour I sent Zoiloff down to see
that food was prepared both for the men and for our
horses; and when another hour passed without any
sign of disturbance the hopes of all of us began to
rise. The one thing that had caused me more anxiety
than anything else was the obstacle which daylight
presented to a successful flight; and when noon came
and passed, and the afternoon shadows began to
lengthen, I was glad enough; for every hour that passed
diminished the risk and increased our chances of
getting to the frontier unseen in the darkness of the
night.</p>

<p>Moreover, the rest was just what the horses needed;
and thus on both accounts the hanging hours of safety
on that hot summer&#8217;s day were doubly precious to us.
Markov was certain that under the cover of the night
he could find his road unerringly; and though his blunder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
in the morning had at first caused such a panic and
had shaken my confidence in his knowledge, I was
ready to believe him now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could drive it blindfolded, your Honour,&#8221; he said
earnestly, when I questioned him. &#8220;I know every
house, and cottage, and tree, almost every bump in the
road&mdash;more than that, I could find my way secretly
across the country were every road and bridle-path
choked with armed men. It is my own country!&#8221; he
exclaimed vehemently.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long will it take you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is fifty miles from the frontier to the first place
where I can get fresh horses, and perhaps fifteen from
here to that&mdash;at the outside say seventy miles. I can
do it in seven hours with such horses as are waiting for
me at every stage&mdash;probably less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be ready to start as soon as it is dusk,&#8221; I
told him, and, as the afternoon passed, I went to
acquaint the Princess with our plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have left us long alone, Count,&#8221; she said with
a smile. &#8220;And I have needed you sorely. Nathalie
here is in distress for news of Lieutenant Spernow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may feel assured on his account,&#8221; I said to the
girl, who was very pale and troubled. &#8220;When we saw
him last he was gaining rapidly on his pursuers, and
was not at all likely to fall into their hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where is he? Why have you no news of him?&#8221;
she wailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably he knows no more than our enemies
where we are. But he is safe. Both Captain Zoiloff
and I are convinced of that.&#8221; Her fears were not to
be stayed by words, however, and in truth I myself
had more than a misgiving on his account.</p>

<p>The Princess was eager for the moment to come when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
she could start, and would have set out at once had I
not told her of the far greater security which darkness
would afford.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time is it now?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just past four. At seven, or soon after, we may
venture to start; and if all goes well, as Heaven grant
it may, you will be across the frontier and in safety
before the sun rises again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall owe it to you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;as indeed I owe
so much already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not more to me than to all here with us. Indeed,
this blessing of a shelter at the very nick of time we
owe to the accident of Markov&#8217;s blunder. We may
well forgive him such a happy mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have me think I owe nothing to you?&#8221;
she asked in a low voice, looking at me with a glance
of love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I may answer that question at a future
time,&#8221; I returned in the same low tone. She blushed
and dropped her eyes and was silent.</p>

<p>In the silence I heard the sounds of some commotion
in the house below, and I started uneasily.
&#8220;Something has happened; I must go and see what
it means!&#8221; I exclaimed; and with a hasty excuse I
hurried away.</p>

<p>Something had indeed happened, for at the bottom
of the stairs I found Spernow and Zoiloff in excited
talk. I called them up, and together we entered the
Princess&#8217;s room, that he might tell us the story of his
experiences, and relieve at once the anxiety of his
sweetheart.</p>

<p>On seeing him she jumped up and, regardless of our
presence, threw herself into his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you really safe, Michel?&#8221; she asked, gazing
into his face with a look I could understand readily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
and, laughing and crying by turns, she plied him with
a hundred questions.</p>

<p>His story was of deep interest and moment to us,
and, though I was in full mood to sympathise with the
lovers, I was eager to hear it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell my story in a very few words,&#8221; he said
at length, turning to us. &#8220;Just after we left Liublian
we were attacked by a party that outnumbered us by
five to one. Our man in the rear galloped up to warn
us as you had ordered him, Count, but the troops were
right on his heels, and, as our horses were anything
but fresh, I dared not risk a race in the effort to reach
you. I determined to fight it out there and then, but
from the first we hadn&#8217;t a chance. The troops fired
not at us, but at the horses, until only two of us were
left mounted. The rest you can gather. We had
never a chance. My men resisted as long as resistance
was possible, but one after another they were surrounded,
disarmed, and secured. When all was lost
we two fled, but some dozen of the troops came pricking
after us. My companion&#8217;s horse was shot; but
almost by a miracle neither my horse nor myself was
touched, though the firing was heavy enough. When
I came down that hill yonder, I saw you, and saw you
turn into the lane. In a moment I knew the mistake
you had made, for I know this country to a yard, and
it occurred to me to pass the entrance to the lane in the
hope that the troops behind me had not seen you. I
made for the next turning, therefore&mdash;that which you
should have taken but happily did not&mdash;and to my intense
relief the men behind, thinking no doubt that I
was following you, followed me. The rest was easy
enough. My horse was fleeter than theirs, and I led
them a dance at a rattling speed for some ten miles.
Then I dismounted, and, giving my horse a whack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
with my hand, sent him on without me, while I slipped
into some bushes and waited for the men to pass.
They did this, swearing prettily, as you may imagine,
and as soon as they had gone by I set off across country
in a bee-line for this place, thinking it not unlikely that
you would take refuge here for a while. And here I
am, and that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our congratulations poured upon him, and then
Zoiloff and I went away, that he and the little Broumoff
might be together. It was the best reward we
could make him just then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those men will try back when they find he&#8217;s fooled
them,&#8221; said Zoiloff, &#8220;and we had better be ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have to come soon,&#8221; said I, &#8220;or they&#8217;ll find
the nest empty and the birds flown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve over two hours yet,&#8221; he returned drily,
and together we went back to our watch-window in the
roof, giving orders that the house was to be kept as
silent as if it were deserted.</p>

<p>The minutes were weighted now with the old fears
and suspense, and scarce a word passed between my
staunch friend and myself. And when we spoke it was
in a whisper, as though the men had already come.
For an hour more nothing occurred to disturb us, and
once again the flame of hope began to kindle. But it
was only to be ruthlessly quenched.</p>

<p>When a glance at my watch told me that an hour
and a quarter had gone by we saw that which made us
start and draw breath quickly.</p>

<p>Two troopers came riding slowly up the lane, looking
carefully to right and left as they approached.
The peasant&#8217;s dog barked loudly, and at the sound they
stopped, and peered curiously at the house. Then they
advanced until they stood close to the yard-gate, and
both stared at the house and spoke together.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>We held our breath in suspense.</p>

<p>The closed doors and shutters puzzled them, and
after a few moments one of them dismounted, handed
the reins of his horse to his companion, pushed open
the gate, and walked up towards the house.</p>

<p>At that moment fortune served us a scurvy trick.
Down below a roar of laughter broke out among our
men, loud enough to reach us.</p>

<p>The soldier heard it too.</p>

<p>We heard him strike a lusty summons on the door
panels and call to those within. Then everything was
as still as the grave.</p>

<p>The man knocked again, and when the door remained
unopened he went back to his companion,
mounted his horse, and, giving some instructions, set
off up the lane at a quick canter. The second man
drew back into the shade of a tree and waited, keeping
his eyes warily upon the house all the while.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may as well get the men posted,&#8221; said Zoiloff.
&#8220;That fellow will be back in a minute with all there
are with him. We&#8217;re in for a scrimmage.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went down at once to give the necessary orders,
while I stayed to watch.</p>

<p>I had not long to wait. In a few minutes I heard
the advancing footfalls of horses, and a number of
troopers came swinging up the lane at the trot. I
counted thirteen in all, and thanked Heaven there
were no more.</p>

<p>But it meant fight, and I saw the man in command
of the party taking his observations, and giving his
instructions to those under him to surround the house.</p>

<p>There was no need for me to watch longer. There
would soon be plenty of other work on hand.</p>

<small>A FORLORN HOPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I left</span> the window and hurried down to tell the
Princess the bad news. Spernow was still there, sitting
apart, exchanging love confidences with Mademoiselle
Broumoff, and they all started up at my sudden
entrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;The troops have found us out, Princess, and there
will probably be some trouble before we get rid of
them and shake them off. I wish to impress upon you
the necessity for you to remain close in the corners of
the room for fear of mishap. Spernow, will you go to
Captain Zoiloff? He is below with the men.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess took the news very calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think they will attack the house?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear so&mdash;or, rather, I hope so; for, if not, we
shall have to attack them, and I would rather act on
the defensive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be danger for you,&#8221; she said earnestly,
looking into my eyes. &#8220;You will be careful&mdash;for my
sake;&#8221; and she laid her hand on mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it will not be serious, and I will be careful,&#8221;
I replied smiling. &#8220;But we must not be beaten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust no blood will be shed&mdash;no lives sacrificed.
I cannot bear the thought of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can have no thought but your safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But can we not be of some use&mdash;Nathalie and I?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>&#8220;I fear not, at present. But if there is need, depend
upon it I will not fail to ask you. Come,
Spernow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Michel, let me have a gun. I would rather be by
your side than cooped up here in suspense,&#8221; cried the
girl with great spirit, holding her lover&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Now
that you are with us I am not afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have not come to that yet, Mademoiselle,&#8221; I
said, liking her spirit and courage. &#8220;You need not be
afraid. We are quite strong enough behind these walls
to cope with the few men against us. But we must
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Christina pressed my hand again, and her lips murmured
a prayer for my safety.</p>

<p>Zoiloff had been busy enough with his preparations,
and when we reached him had posted his men. He
had done a shrewd trick on leaving General Kolfort&#8217;s
house, and had brought away with him the men&#8217;s carbines
with a quantity of ammunition. These were now
distributed in the rooms from which the work of defence
was to be carried on; and he explained that his
object was to create the impression that we were a
much more numerous party than in reality.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can fire volleys from the different windows in
very rapid succession, and they&#8217;ll think the place is
alive with men,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the main work must
be done from the windows of each room on the floor
above us. There are two in the front room and one at
the back, and we can from there command the approach
to the front and back doors, and could hold the
place against four times the number.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went to the front room and looked out.</p>

<p>The soldiers were taking matters very leisurely.
Evidently they were confident that they would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
no serious difficulty in carrying the house, even if we
were inside, of which they still seemed to have doubts.</p>

<p>The leader was only a non-commissioned officer&mdash;a
troop sergeant&mdash;and he appeared to be at a loss what
to do. He was consulting with the two men who had
ridden up first, and all three were gesticulating freely
as they pointed to different parts of the house and
yard.</p>

<p>The longer they debated, and the more time they
wasted, the better for us. If they would only let the
afternoon steal away and twilight come, we could in
the last resource make a sally, have a brush at close
quarters, and then trust to our horses to save us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zoiloff, I have a plan,&#8221; I said, as an idea struck
me. &#8220;That man has made a fool&#8217;s mistake. Every
horse there is in full view, and can be picked off easily.
Let our first volleys, when it comes to firing, be for
the horses. Before the men even guess our intention,
every horse will be killed or disabled, and not only will
the men be unable to follow us, but prevented from
riding for help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have every man at
these two windows, and each man shall pick out his
own target. A couple of rounds well aimed and the
thing&#8217;s done. But someone must keep a lookout at
the back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nathalie will do that,&#8221; said Spernow eagerly; and
he went at once to ask her, while the men were brought
into the room and their orders given to them. We
waited, watching closely for the commencement of
hostilities.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t like the look of things,&#8221; whispered
Zoiloff, smiling grimly, &#8220;and don&#8217;t know what to do
or how to start. Ah, now they&#8217;ve settled something,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
he added as the leader came towards the house, knocked
at the door, and called in a loud voice for it to be
opened.</p>

<p>No answer was given, of course, and after he had
repeated his summons he called:</p>

<p>&#8220;If the door is not opened we shall break it in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Getting no reply, he returned to his men, and sent
four of them round to the back of the house. Then
one of the men called his attention to something at
the side of the yard, and eight of them went and picked
up a heavy balk of timber lying there.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to use it as a battering-ram,&#8221; said
Zoiloff. &#8220;We must stop that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; I said quickly. &#8220;When they are in position
I&#8217;ll warn them, and through the open windows we
can then shoot the horses. Remember, men, level
your guns first at the men, and when I tell you, aim
at the horses, and shoot straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The timber was heavy, the afternoon hot, the men
fatigued and with no great zest for the business, so
that they took a long time before they had brought it
round near the door.</p>

<p>Then I threw up the window sharply, and called, in
a ringing voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! We sha&#8217;n&#8217;t allow that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking up, the troopers found themselves covered
by the guns of our party, and, dropping the timber,
they rushed like hares for cover&mdash;all save the leader,
who flung curses at them for their cowardice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now fire,&#8221; I said; and, levelling my rifle, I picked
out a horse, and we fired our first volley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick! again!&#8221; and a second volley rang out.</p>

<p>The effect was indescribable. Five horses fell at
the first round, and the rest stampeded and plunged so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
violently that any accurate aim the second time was
very difficult. Only three fell, but the rest broke from
their fastenings in a very frenzy of fear and galloped
wildly off, plunging across country at a speed that made
any thought of pursuit hopeless.</p>

<p>The men started to follow them, but were recalled
by the leader, and came slinking back to cover like
whipped dogs.</p>

<p>The loss of the horses was not their only misfortune,
however, for in getting the log they had set down their
carbines near the gate in a spot which we could cover
with our guns. Seeing this, I called again:</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who touches one of those guns will be
shot!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant had plenty of pluck, and, though sorely
perplexed by the turn things had thus suddenly taken,
was as cool as if he had been on parade.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want here?&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know who&#8217;s in the house,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am. What next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I decline to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you surrender without causing any more
trouble?&#8221; he asked coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you ask that again, you&#8217;ll stand a good chance
of asking no more questions in this world,&#8221; said I drily.
&#8220;You had better draw off your men while they are
still unhurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t hope to beat us off,&#8221; he said doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can try.&#8221; At the reply he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you resist you must take the consequences,&#8221; he
called.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite prepared for that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>He turned away then as if to walk back to his men,
but I saw him start; and then he did a really plucky
thing, like the daring devil he evidently was. When
he was half-way towards his men he made a quick
rush to the guns and tried to snatch them up in his
arms and bolt with them to cover. It was wasted
courage. A couple of guns rang out, Zoiloff&#8217;s for one,
and the man rolled over with a groan, shot through the
leg, with the carbines scattered round him.</p>

<p>His men made no effort to go near him, and so long
an interval of inaction followed that I began to hope
the struggle was already over before it had well begun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky we shot those horses, or we should have had
half the scoundrels bolting for reinforcements,&#8221; muttered
Zoiloff.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better see what the men at the back are
after,&#8221; I said; and even as I spoke the little Broumoff
came running excitedly to tell us they were trying to
get our horses from the shed behind.</p>

<p>Zoiloff hurried out with a couple of men, and a moment
later I heard an exchange of shots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run and see what has happened, Spernow, and let
me know,&#8221; I said, and in a couple of minutes he returned
to say all was well, and that Zoiloff had wounded one
of the men and scared them off. They had made for
the side of the house, he told me, and had been joined
by the rest of the troopers; unfortunately there was
no window at the side, so that we could neither watch
nor threaten them.</p>

<p>Another long interval passed without the troopers
making a sign of any kind, and I judged that their intention
was simply to keep watch until reinforcements
could come up, and guessed that they had sent one or
more of the men away on foot in search of help.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>It was now past six o&#8217;clock, and in less than half an
hour it would be safe to make a start. I went to
Zoiloff to consult.</p>

<p>My plan was to make a rush upon the men and drive
them away sufficiently far to admit of our horses being
put in the cart, and then risk the chances of flight. He
agreed readily, for the inaction was vastly less to his
mind than any fighting, and we made our preparations
accordingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are seven to their nine or ten, say. The leader
lies there wounded, you have disabled a second man,
and they have sent away probably two and certainly
one; and as we are armed and they are not, and we
shall catch them unawares, we can certainly beat them
off. We must then get the horses ready and be off.
The sun&#8217;s low now, and, as there is a mist rising, it will
be dark enough for our purposes long before seven.
And, anyway, we can&#8217;t wait here to be trapped like
rabbits as soon as they succeed in bringing up reinforcements.&#8221;</p>

<p>We set to work at once. The barricade of the back
door was removed quietly and we all mustered by it in
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence till we are outside,&#8221; I whispered. &#8220;Then
with a rush fall on them with more noise than force,
and scare and drive them off.&#8221;</p>

<p>I lifted the latch noiselessly and, opening the door,
stepped out, followed by the rest. Then with a loud
shout we rushed round the house and caught the men
as they stood smoking and talking, expecting nothing
less than an attack from us.</p>

<p>They fled like chaff, helter-skelter in all directions,
not venturing even a pretence at resistance. The two
or three who had guns attempted to fire, but we struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
up their arms and they fled as incontinently as the
rest.</p>

<p>We made a show of pursuit, but it was no more than
a show, and then all hands turned to the work of getting
the horses harnessed and saddled. Meanwhile the
mist was rising fast, and promised to form a welcome
veil to our flight.</p>

<p>As a precaution I told one of our men to ride some
distance along the lane to see that the road was clear,
although I had no doubt that the troopers had been
effectively disposed of; and I went to fetch the Princess
and Mademoiselle Broumoff. All was ready and
we were in good heart, when the man I had sent out
came scampering back with news that filled me with
sudden consternation.</p>

<p>He had seen a large body of horse-soldiers at the end
of the lane on the high road, and with them were
several of the men we had just beaten off.</p>

<p>I heard the news with genuine anguish of soul. We
were hemmed in. The absence of any outlet except by
the lane made escape absolutely hopeless, and for a
moment I was borne down with despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can only make a forlorn hope of it,&#8221; said Zoiloff.
&#8220;Charge them and try to make off in the confusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bit my lip and racked my brains in the effort to
find some other than this useless, desperate scheme,
and then suddenly a light beamed through the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Markov, can you find your way across the fields at
the back here to the road&mdash;on horseback I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly, your Honour, but with the cart&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zoiloff, good friend, we must part now. There is
only one way. You and Markov must ride with the
Princess on horseback, escaping by the back across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
fields till you strike the road. I must go in the cart
with Mademoiselle Broumoff, if she is brave enough to
risk this for the Princess;&#8221; and I looked at her eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do anything,&#8221; she assented readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will make them think that only we six were in
the house here; that Mademoiselle Broumoff is the
Princess, and that we are making the rush to escape
after the fight just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot consent to that,&#8221; said Christina earnestly.
&#8220;You will be going to certain capture.&#8221;</p>

<p>I drew her aside from the rest to urge her, and
Zoiloff, understanding things with the quick instinct
of a friend, led them out of the room on the plea of
hastening the preparations.</p>

<p>As soon as we were alone she threw off all reserve,
putting her hands on my shoulders and gazing at me
with glowing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you press me to do this?&#8221; she pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must; it is your only hope of safety, and a desperate
one at the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You love me&mdash;Gerald?&#8221;</p>

<p>At the sound of my name, spoken prettily in tremulous
hesitation, I felt the blood rush to my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;With my whole heart,&#8221; I cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not send me from you, then; I urge you, by
our love. Let us face what has to come together. I
could meet death with you, but without you I am a
coward. I cannot go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go, Christina,&#8221; I said in a low voice, and
scarcely steadier than her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is sending you to death, Gerald. I cannot do it.
I could not live if harm came to you through me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No such harm as that can come. But, for God&#8217;s
sake, think. If we remain together now it can be but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
for a few minutes. If we fell into these men&#8217;s hands,
their first act would be to separate us. You must go,
my darling, you must.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a deep, heavy, sobbing sigh, and let her
head fall on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is worse than death to go alone like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is our only chance for a happier life. You must
go, and even these moments of delay are imperilling
everything. You must go&mdash;and at once. God knows
how gladly I would have you stay with me if I dared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then go with me. Captain Zoiloff will&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The
look on my face checked the sentence. &#8220;Oh, I cannot
part with you, I cannot!&#8221; She moaned in such agony
that my heart ached. &#8220;We may never meet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall meet again with you in safety, do not
fear,&#8221; I said, trying to put a ring of hope into my
voice, though my heart echoed her cry. &#8220;You must
go, my dearest;&#8221; and I began to lead her to the door,
for every moment now might turn the balance between
safety and capture.</p>

<p>As I moved she threw herself into my arms and
clung to me convulsively. I held her to my heart;
her face was close to me; my lips sought hers, and
our very souls seemed to rush together in that kiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Till death, Christina,&#8221; I whispered passionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Till death, Gerald,&#8221; she answered; and then with
a long, trembling sigh she drew from me. &#8220;Oh, how
hard is fate!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, sweetheart,&#8221; I said; and without another
word I led her out to the horses, to where good Zoiloff
was waiting with gloomy growing impatience.</p>

<p>I lifted her tenderly to the saddle, and with a last
yearning look and a lingering pressure of the hand I
turned away, sick and sad with the sorrow of it all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>Zoiloff was mounted by then, and I wrung his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guard her with your life, friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With my life,&#8221; he answered to the full as earnestly
as I.</p>

<p>The plucky little Broumoff was already in the cart,
with Spernow close to her, and in another moment I
was by her side.</p>

<p>There was still no sign of any troopers, and as for
my scheme it was necessary that they should see us, I
led my party round to the front.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you hear the sound of our wheels, steal off
at once, and make across the fields there for the road,&#8221;
I said, as a last word; &#8220;you will be out of sight in the
mist before the men have a thought that we are not
all together. Good-bye, and may God speed you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amen to that,&#8221; came in Zoiloff&#8217;s deep voice, and
for the last time I met Christina&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>When I reached the front of the house I waited a
moment, listening intently, and then hearing the sound
of horsemen coming up the lane I started my horses,
and as soon as we were through the gate I whipped
them and dashed along the lane at a smart gallop,
just as the foremost couple of troopers loomed into
sight through the shroud of the white mist.</p>

<small>A FRIEND IN NEED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> I was certain that we were rushing
straight upon inevitable capture, I still had it in my
mind to make a strenuous dash to get through the
soldiers, and I flogged the horses vigorously, and told
my companion to cling hard to her seat, for the cart
swayed and bumped and jolted over the rough road in
a manner that threatened to send us sprawling into the
lane at every second.</p>

<p>&#8220;Draw that hood over your face to conceal it as
much as possible, and remember if we are caught I
shall address you as &#8216;the Princess,&#8217;&#8221; I said to my
companion. &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you now what I think of
your courage.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did what I asked, and her features were so concealed
that, had the troopers known the Princess by
sight, they could not have seen it was not she by my
side.</p>

<p>The first party numbered under a dozen men, and
as we approached they made no effort to stop us, but
drew their horses aside and let us pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they following us?&#8221; I asked anxiously, for
that would be the test whether my ruse was to fail or
succeed.</p>

<p>The girl glanced back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. They&#8217;ve closed in behind and are galloping
after us.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>&#8220;Thank God for that!&#8221; I cried; and I laid the whip
on the horses again till they were travelling at headlong,
desperate, racing speed.</p>

<p>Then in the mist, as we neared the end of the lane,
I saw the main body drawn up in a mass completely
blocking the road. They had evidently heard us
coming and were prepared for us, and they sat on their
horses with their carbines levelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt there! or we fire,&#8221; shouted someone.</p>

<p>But he might as well have shouted to a mountain
torrent to stop, for my horses were smarting under the
whip I had laid on so generously, and no driver on
earth could have stayed their wild rush. Indeed, the
words were scarcely out of his lips before we plunged
madly right into the midst of them, scattering them
to right and left and sending them cannoning one
against the other in the utmost confusion.</p>

<p>The officer in command had formed them in a bad
order for such a reckless charge as ours. The chief
strength was at the sides, and in the middle, where our
horses by luck carried us, the line was only two deep.</p>

<p>The check was thus but momentary. There was a
violent shock as we dashed against the first horseman;
my horses stumbled and I thought would fall. My
companion and I were jerked violently forward nearly
on to their backs, but in a second and scarcely with a
pause they recovered, and before I could realise what
had happened we were through the ranks and clear of
them, with Spernow and another man close behind us
and dashing along again with barely abated fury for the
main road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie down on the floor of the cart; they may fire
after us,&#8221; I cried. The next instant the guns rang out
and the bullets came whistling past our ears. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
aim was bad, and the jolting and swaying of the cart
as it lunged over the ruts helped us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you all right, Spernow?&#8221; I called over my
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I am alone. The two behind me were
stopped in that business just now, and the other has
just gone down. By God, it was splendidly done,
Count. But they&#8217;re streaming after us in full cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was nearing the corner now, and remembered the
sharp awkward turn with something of a shudder. I
did not care which way we went; but the cattle knew
the road and seemed to care, for they turned for their
old stables at Liublian with a swerve that tilted the
cart to such an angle that it was nothing less than a
miracle that we did not upset.</p>

<p>It righted, however, and once on the main road we
darted off on our mad flight at a speed which made the
misty air sting my face with rushing damp in it.</p>

<p>I was right glad that we had turned that way. The
men behind would be sure to think I had taken it purposely,
and thus we should draw off pursuit from
Christina effectually, and every mile that we could
now contrive to cover meant two miles&#8217; start for her.</p>

<p>The race could not continue for long. I knew that,
and knew, too, how it must end unless some unforeseen
accident happened; but I meant to make the most of
the opportunity to lead the men as far from Christina
as possible, and with this object I flogged the horses
until they flew along like things possessed at such a
speed that Spernow, though he was well mounted,
could hardly keep up with us.</p>

<p>In this reckless way, up hill and down at the same
headlong, breakneck pace, our limbs and lives at hazard
with every bad bit of road we covered, we raced for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
some miles till we came to the foot of a steep hill,
which, I remembered, was as long as it was steep. The
horses charged at it in the same gallant, desperate way,
but our pursuers had now gained on us and were closing
up fast.</p>

<p>They had not fired another volley, and though at
first I wondered at this, and could not guess the cause
I was soon to learn it. When we turned in the direction
of Liublian they knew that we could not escape
them, and were content to ride us down or wait till we
ran against some other body of troops. The hill now
helped them, for the wild pace had distressed my horses
until they began to falter at the steep ascent, breathing
hard. I flogged them unmercifully; I would have every
yard out of them that was to be got, because it meant
a yard longer start for Christina; but my heart was
sore for the brutes, for they had made a valiant effort.</p>

<p>Before we reached the crest of the hill the troops
were up with us, and the leader, pointing ahead, called
to me to surrender.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better give up the struggle, Count Benderoff,&#8221;
he said, riding abreast of me. &#8220;We have another
body of men at the top there.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I was fighting for yards, and my answer was to
cut the horses desperately with the whip, so that they
sprang forward again with a last frantic effort. The
man rode to the nearest horse, and, drawing his revolver,
placed it close to the animal&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be sorry to fire, but if you don&#8217;t stop I shall
have no alternative,&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we yield?&#8221; I said, turning to the little Broumoff,
who had maintained her seat unflinchingly, and
pretending to consult her, while I whispered, &#8220;Keep
your face well concealed.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>She nodded, and I drew the horses to a standstill.</p>

<p>&#8220;We yield only under protest,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you spared me an unpleasant job,&#8221; replied
the officer, putting his revolver away, and saluting
the &#8220;Princess.&#8221; &#8220;Your animals have made a magnificent
struggle, but you have been racing all the time
toward certain capture, Count Benderoff. Escape
from the first moment was hopeless.&#8221; We waited then
in silence while his men drew up and surrounded us.
&#8220;Will you drive Her Highness into Liublian?&#8221;</p>

<p>All the horses were greatly distressed, and we waited
a few minutes for them to recover, and then went forward
at a slow pace. I had been anxious to hurry
before, but now I kept my animals at the walk, and
halted more than once on the steep hill. It was my
cue now to waste as much time as possible before the
identity of my companion should be discovered, and I
thought with glee of the long start which Christina
would have.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill the other soldiers met us,
and the two officers spoke together for a minute, discussing
the incidents of our capture. Then we went
forward again at a very slow pace.</p>

<p>We reached Liublian an hour and a half after leaving
the homestead; and there again fortune favoured
us. No one was there to recognise my companion, and
we had to push on to General Kolfort&#8217;s house, still at
a slow pace, for I declared my horses were so beaten
they could not travel beyond a walk. I managed to
occupy another hour over the drive, and with this start,
which meant nearly five hours to Christina, I felt hopeful
she would reach the frontier safely. My ruse had
succeeded far beyond my best hopes.</p>

<p>As we drew up at the General&#8217;s house, I smiled to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
myself as I pictured his fury at the discovery; but he
was not there. He had returned hastily to Sofia, I
overheard; but the place was packed with troops, and
he had left some drastic orders for our disposal.</p>

<p>I helped the plucky little Broumoff from the cart
with a very deferential air and led her into the house,
Spernow in close attendance. They took us into a
room on the ground floor, where three officers awaited
us, one of them being Captain Wolasky, who, to my
surprise, gave no response to my start of recognition.</p>

<p>A chair was placed for the &#8220;Princess,&#8221; and she was
shrewd enough to seat herself so that the light of the
lamp left her face in the shadow. I could have laughed
at the comedy underlying the situation, but, assuming
a tone of hot indignation, I exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I demand to know the reason why I am subjected
to this infamous treatment! What is the meaning of
this arrest?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man in the centre of the three looked up
angrily:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not in my instructions to give you any such
needless information, sir. You must be fully aware
of what you have done. You are the Count Benderoff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the Hon. Gerald Winthrop, as well as the
Count Benderoff, and a British subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Englishmen are much too prone to meddle in matters
that don&#8217;t concern them, and must be prepared to
take the consequences,&#8221; he answered drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;There may also be consequences for those who
meddle with them,&#8221; I returned hotly; and with the
object of provoking him into a personal dispute so as
to waste more time, I poured out a volume of protests
and objections, together with loud and angry demands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
for a specific charge; and in this way prolonged the
wrangle for many minutes.</p>

<p>He ordered me at length to be silent, under threat
of packing me out of the room, and then he turned to
the &#8220;Princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I much regret, Princess, to have to put you to inconvenience,
but my instructions are imperative. You
will have to remain in this house for the night; but
arrangements have been made for your personal comfort,
and to-morrow General Kolfort&#8217;s intention will be
explained to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no reply other than to bow, as if in
acquiescence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must ask you to remove your disguise,&#8221; he said
next, just as I was hoping she would even then escape
recognition. She made no attempt to comply with
the request, and it was repeated in a sharper tone.</p>

<p>She turned to me as if to ask what to do, and, seeing
the end had come, I broke in:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is another of your ridiculous proceedings,&#8221; I
said warmly. &#8220;Not only am I personally treated in
this outrageous manner, but, because I am seen driving
on the highway, you must needs conclude that the
Princess Christina is with me. It is shameful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, sir?&#8221; cried the officer hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply that this young lady is no more the Princess
Christina than you are. You may as well draw your
hood back to show the mistake,&#8221; I added to Mademoiselle
Broumoff, who did so then, to the complete consternation
of all the three officers. I could have
smiled at their utter bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the Princess Christina?&#8221; asked the chief
sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are at least as anxious as you can be on that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
point,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;If your men make blunders of
this kind, and don&#8217;t know the difference between
her Highness and her friends, who can tell where
she is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find it a hazardous work to play tricks on
us!&#8221; he cried furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I play tricks on you, indeed! It is you who seem
to be amusing yourselves with us,&#8221; I said, with an insolent
laugh. &#8220;But you will have to answer for it, I
promise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; he shouted; and I shrugged my shoulders
and threw up my hands in response.</p>

<p>He muttered some hurried instructions to Captain
Wolasky, who left the room to carry them out. I
glanced at my watch. It was a quarter to ten; three
hours since Christina had started, and I calculated
that, if all had gone well, she would be at least two
stages to the frontier, and beyond hope of pursuit by
any troops that could now be despatched after her.
For aught else I cared nothing.</p>

<p>I edged close to Spernow, and managed to whisper
to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you get a chance try to steal off, you two, in
the confusion;&#8221; and just as I had said this Captain
Wolasky came back with a file of soldiers, and the
officer at the table ordered them to lead me away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have your orders, Captain Wolasky,&#8221; he said
in sharp, peremptory tones, and I was led away,
Wolasky following me.</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;I RODE BETWEEN TWO TROOPERS.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Page <a href="#Page_299">299</a>.</i></p>

<p>He took me out through the hall, now thronged with
soldiers, to the front of the house, where a small troop
of horsemen were drawn up; and then, halting at a
spot where the light of a lamp fell full upon his face, he
looked at me with a peculiar expression in his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
which I did not understand, and said in an unnecessarily
harsh, strident tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have played us too many tricks for me to dare
to take your parole not to escape, sir; and if you
are treated with indignity you have yourself to blame
for it. Bind the prisoner&#8217;s hands behind him!&#8221; he
said roughly to a couple of men near; and a murmur
of approval came from the troopers standing around,
mingled with a good deal of strong Russian.</p>

<p>&#8220;I protest against the outrage!&#8221; I shouted, and
commenced to struggle. It was useless, of course,
and I was held, and my hands fastened behind me.
&#8220;Where am I being taken? I demand to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll demand you,&#8221; said Wolasky, in a voice of passion;
and, seizing me, he pushed me forward to where
a horse stood riderless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse this farce,&#8221; he whispered; &#8220;but it is necessary;&#8221;
and he covered the whisper with a loud imprecation
and abuse of me. I was so astonished that I
forgot to resist. &#8220;Struggle,&#8221; he whispered again; and
then I set to work to play my part with a will, and
fought and struggled so desperately as they were forcing
me to mount, that the Captain appeared to lose
his temper, and struck at me, taking care, however,
that the blow spent itself in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch him,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;and at the least sign of
treachery, shoot him like a dog. It doesn&#8217;t matter
whether he reaches Tirnova alive or dead, so long as
he does reach there;&#8221; and again some of the soldiers
clustered about, laughed and oathed in evident glee.</p>

<p>I rode between two troopers, whose horses were fastened
to mine by light chains attached to the bits,
while each man held a rein; and, as we started in this
alarming fashion, some ruffian shouted after us to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
the &#8220;damned English dog safe on the chain.&#8221; &#8220;Tie
his legs under the horse&#8217;s belly, and he&#8217;ll keep on, dead
or alive,&#8221; cried another; and a burst of ribald laughter
followed, in which those about me joined.</p>

<p>In this fashion we rode through Liublian, struck off
to the right, and soon after began the ascent of a steep
hilly country, which made the travelling very slow.
We moved at no more than a walking pace all the
time, making, as I judged, about four miles an hour;
but we kept on all through the night, and did not halt
until the sun was up, and we reached a small village,
where we dismounted and had breakfast.</p>

<p>I was overpowered with fatigue, and so soon as I
had eaten the food brought to me I fell into a deep
sleep. In about three hours I was awakened and the
march resumed. The sun was overpowering, and
towards midday a halt was called under some trees.
Here again I slept, and when, in the late afternoon, I
awoke, I was vastly refreshed, and began to think about
the chances of escape.</p>

<p>I had been treated all the time with the sternest
measures. The Captain did not come near me; and,
when we halted, my legs were bound before my hands
were liberated for me to take any food. The country
was of course entirely strange, and when I asked a
question of the men on either side of me they ordered
me with an oath to be silent.</p>

<p>When the sun was getting low in the afternoon
Captain Wolasky reined up to my side, and, pointing
to a road we passed, he said in a jeering, insulting tone,
but with the same expression I had noticed on his face
the night before:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the road you&#8217;d like to take, Mr. Count Englishman;
feast your eyes on it, for you won&#8217;t see it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
again, I promise you. See, it leads to Sofia over yonder;&#8221;
and he pointed far away over the hills to where
the sun&#8217;s rays were shining on some distant buildings.</p>

<p>I looked eagerly enough, for I thought I understood
him, and I began to pay special heed to the road along
which they took me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s prettier scenery than Tirnova,&#8221; he cried, with
another loud jeering laugh, as he went on again to lead
the party.</p>

<p>After that we travelled on a fairly level road for
about two miles, when another halt was called for the
soldiers&#8217; evening meal. My legs were tied as before,
and a good meal brought to me, and in moving to put
away the cup and platter I noticed that my legs were
fastened so loosely that I could slip them out in a
moment.</p>

<p>The dusk had fallen, and the mist risen, so that the
whole party were enveloped in gloom, and I heard the
Captain say to the men, who were sitting at a short
distance from me:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve a long night ride, and I shan&#8217;t halt again
before dawn. You&#8217;d better snatch an hour&#8217;s sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw in a moment that the whole thing had been
arranged cleverly for my escape, and that the Captain
himself had told me in his insulting tone the road I must
make for. I threw myself back and pretended to sleep,
and the man on guard over me&mdash;a fat, heavy fellow,
whom the fatigue of the ride had already worn out&mdash;first
satisfied himself that I was as sound asleep as I
was when we had halted previously, and then curled
himself up to follow my example.</p>

<p>With the greatest care I drew my legs out of their
bonds and sat up. The men were breathing heavily in
deep slumber, while the fellow close to me was snoring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
vigorously. I glanced around, and just above me on
the road I should take was the Captain&#8217;s horse tethered
alone. He was by far the fleetest and best-blooded
animal in the troop, and once on his back I could laugh
at pursuit. That he had been left there was due to no
accident, I was convinced; and stealthily, inch by inch,
holding my breath in my excitement, I began to crawl
toward him.</p>

<p>I reached him unnoticed, and, stroking his neck, I
cast off the tether, and led him away for a few paces
along the soft turf. All was dead silence in the little
camp of sleepers, and in the murky mist I could see
nothing of them and they could see nothing of me.</p>

<p>I led the horse until I reckoned to be out of earshot,
and then mounted and set off at a canter, keeping on
the turf as long as possible.</p>

<p>Suddenly a loud shout behind me from the men announced
that the fact of my escape had been discovered,
and, driving my heels into the horse&#8217;s side, I
dashed off at a rapid gallop for the road which Captain
Wolasky had said was the road to Sofia. I found it
without difficulty, of course, and paused a moment at
the turning to listen for signs of pursuit.</p>

<p>I could hear nothing, but resolved to make the best
of my start, and galloped off at a pace which showed
the splendid quality of the animal under me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />


<small>A FEARSOME DILEMMA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I plunged along in my wild ride through the
quickly darkening gloom, I began to take stock of my
position and shape some kind of plans. Beyond the
statement that the lane would lead me to Sofia, I had
not a notion of where I was, and the twists and turns
of the road along which I was galloping madly soon
caused me to lose all knowledge of the direction in
which Sofia lay.</p>

<p>But this did not trouble me very much. I was mounted
on a splendid animal; I was armed, for I found the
Captain&#8217;s revolver in the holster; and I had money in
my pockets enough to more than serve any needs
likely to arise.</p>

<p>I did not much fear any serious pursuit. The same
timely friendship which had led Captain Wolasky to
venture so much for me would, I was sure, suffice to
induce him to lead the pursuit in any direction but
that which he knew I should take; and after I had
covered a few miles I halted and listened again for any
sounds of followers. There was not a sound, and after
that I determined to proceed leisurely, and so spare
my horse for any effort should I stumble across any
patrolling party of troops.</p>

<p>My wish was, of course, to push for the frontier;
but, as the city lay between me and the west road, and
as moreover I knew neither how to find a way round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
the city, and thus avoid the risk of crossing it, nor my
road to the frontier, should I ever be able to get
through Sofia safely, I was much puzzled what course
to take.</p>

<p>I could of course trust to the chance of being able
to make inquiries as I went, but there was so much
risk in such a course that I feared it. If I was to get
through safely, I knew I must ride for the most part
at night, because the daylight spelt a double danger to
me. It was practically certain that the main road
would be infested by Kolfort&#8217;s men, and the chances
of my being able to evade them all were infinitesimal.</p>

<p>Another scheme suggested itself to me&mdash;hazardous,
no doubt&mdash;but possibly not so dangerous as the alternative.
Markov had given me a plan of his route to
the frontier, with a list of the places and persons where
he had arranged for the relays of horses; but in the
confusion and hurry of my departure from Sofia I had
left this behind me. It was not of much consequence
so long as he had been present to act as guide, but
without him it had become of vital importance. My
present idea was therefore to risk a return to my own
house, get the paper, which was locked up in a secret
cabinet in my library, and perhaps remain hidden in
the house during the following day, setting out on my
journey to the frontier when darkness came to help
me.</p>

<p>The obstacle to the scheme was, of course, the possibility
that my house might be in the possession of
Kolfort&#8217;s agents, and that I might run my head into a
trap. But the house contained so many secret ways
and passages that this risk was greatly lessened; and I
reckoned that I could at least effect an entrance without
being discovered, and if I found the project impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
could leave it again. In any case, the possession of
the plan of route was so essential to me under the
circumstances that I made up my mind to run the risk
of the venture.</p>

<p>I had first to find my way to the city, however, and
in this I was singularly fortunate. I had ridden some
three or four hours when the moon rose, and soon
afterwards, to my intense satisfaction, my cross road
came out at a point which I recognised as being some
four or five miles from my house. I quickened my
pace, therefore, riding very warily, and, wherever possible,
cantering on the turf, until I came out on the
heath which was close to the mouth of the underground
passage leading under my grounds. I would
not trust myself to use that because its secret was
known to Kolfort&#8217;s agents; but I chose a path which
led me to another gate of the garden.</p>

<p>I dismounted there, unlocked the gate, drew my
horse under the shadow of some trees, fastened him,
and, thrusting the revolver into my belt for use in case
of need, crept forward to reconnoitre the house.</p>

<p>Every window at the back was in darkness, even to
the kitchens, and the place seemed empty and deserted.
Keeping well within the shadow of the walls, I stole
round with the utmost caution to the front, taking
care that every footfall should be deadened by either
the turf or the soft mould of the flower beds.</p>

<p>In the front there was a faint light from one window;
a carriage stood in the roadway, and, near the gates
opening from the drive, I saw one or two moving
shadows of men.</p>

<p>The carriage surprised and startled me. Obviously
someone was taking a keen interest in my concerns,
and was inside the house; and I had to consider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
whether I dared to venture any further with my plan
in the face of such added danger. A minute&#8217;s thought
determined me to proceed, however. What I had
feared was the presence of a fairly large number of
men holding possession of the house; but there was
no sign of this, and if only one or two attendants were
with this visitor, whoever it might be, they would not
have an easy task to capture me, while I should not
have a difficult one to avoid them.</p>

<p>At the side where I stood there was a small opening
into a passage that led straight to my library, and,
unlocking it very softly, I entered, and stole along it
on tiptoe, feeling my way by the wall in the pitchy
darkness. There were several doors leading off from
the narrow passage to different parts of the house, and
at each of these I stood and listened intently, venturing
to unlock one or two of them with my master-key.
In this way I was able to satisfy myself that not a soul
was in the lower part of the house, and, assured by
this knowledge, I crept up the stone staircase that led
to the library.</p>

<p>The need for absolute silence on my part increased
with every step, and when I reached the top I drew off
my heaving riding boots and moved at a snail&#8217;s pace,
my stockinged feet making no noise whatever.</p>

<p>The entrance to the passage from the room had been
masked very cleverly. It was formed by a revolving
panel in the wall, which swung on well-oiled pivots and
opened behind a sham cabinet, through the painted
glass doors of which care had been taken to allow of
anyone who stood in the cabinet both hearing and
seeing all that went on in the room. I moved the
panel inch by inch with infinite care and caution, and
as I did so heard the sound of voices.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>I started, and almost lost my presence of mind as I
recognised the deep, gruff tone of General Kolfort,
followed by the soft, dulcet, seductive laugh of the
Countess Bokara. Passing noiselessly through the
panel, I entered the cabinet, and the sight that met
my eyes made me almost cry out in astonishment.</p>

<p>The wily old Russian had for once met more than
his match. He was seated in a chair with his arms
fastened behind the back of it, staring up, with leaden
face and fear-filled eyes, into the face of the woman
who stood over him with a long, deadly-looking dagger
in her raised hand, passion and hate blazing in her
eyes, and making the blade tremble in her grasp so
that the light quivered and danced on the steel as the
taunting, scoffing words flowed volubly from her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are to die. I lured you here for the purpose&mdash;lured
you, as you say, with lies about the secret
proofs of this Count&#8217;s guilt which I could put into
your hands. A single movement, and my blade strikes
home to its sheath in your treacherous old heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words came through her clenched teeth, and
she looked a very she-devil as she gloated over her
helpless and cowering victim. He might well cower,
for if ever the lust for human blood was written on a
human face, it was there in every line of hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he asked at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but revenge. Nothing but that you shall
feel before you die some of the pain and horror you
and your cursed agents and spies have made my Prince
endure for months past; nothing but to know that at
last our accounts are squared, and what you tried and
failed to do with me I have tried and succeeded in
doing with you; nothing but your life, murderer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can name your own terms,&#8221; he said again; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
I saw him glance about him as if in desperate search of
some faint hope of escape from the menacing knife.
She saw the glance too, and laughed, a fiend&#8217;s laugh,
scornful, sneering, and utterly loathsome.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may look where you will, but you remember
your own condition&mdash;alone in the house. Alone, that
you might not be seen with me, or perhaps might trap
me with more of your damnable treachery. Well,
you&#8217;ve had your way, and we are alone; but it&#8217;s the
trapper who is trapped, the spider who is caught in his
own web. I&#8217;m glad you are afraid of death. I thought
it would be so, you are so prompt and quick to order
the deaths of others. And now you want to find proofs
that will enable you to have this Englishman put out
of your way, something to give a colour to your order
for his removal; and when your men had searched here
and found nothing strong enough, you swallowed the
bait I put to you, to guide you to the place where you
should find all you wanted and more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is no friend of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that to me? You are my enemy, and here
helpless in my power. The great, powerful, ruthless,
implacable enemy of my Prince and of Bulgaria here
alone, fastened like a child to a chair by the hand of a
woman. Where is your power now? Will it help you
to unfasten even a strand of your bonds? Will it
bring a single soul to your aid? Will it stay by a
second the plunge of my knife, or turn by so much as
a hair&#8217;s breadth the point from your heart? Were you
as feeble as the meanest and weakest of your victims,
you could not be more helpless than alone here with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bloodthirsty fury of this unsexed demon was a
hateful sight. Had she plunged her knife into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
man&#8217;s heart in a paroxysm of rage I could have understood
the passion which impelled her to her act of
revenge, but it was loathsome to see her standing
gloating over the wretched, quivering old man. I
made up my mind to stop her; and I was about to
dash into the room to tear the knife from her grasp,
for I could stand the sight no longer, when a thought
inspired by his fear struck me. Like a flash of light a
way to safety for me darted into my mind. If he was
the coward at heart she had proved him I could turn
his fears to good account, and in a moment I turned as
anxious to save his life as I was to end the intolerable
sight of her cruel, tigerish, callous gloating.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have tried to murder my Prince, and now you
have dragged him from his throne to some of your vile
Russian prisons,&#8221; she began again, when I burst open
the doors of my hiding-place, darted upon her before
she could recover from her start of surprise, and, pushing
her back, stood between her and the General.</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; she cried in a voice choking with baffled
passion, and looking for all the world as though she
would spring on me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; I said sternly. &#8220;This has gone on too
long already. I will have no murder of this kind done
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard the old man behind me give a deep sigh of
relief, and, glancing round, I saw that his head had
dropped back on his shoulders. He had fainted in the
sudden relaxation of the terrible strain, and with his
dead white face upturned, open-mouthed and staring-eyed,
he looked like a corpse.</p>

<p>But I could give him no more than a glance, for I
dared not keep my eyes from the wild woman before
me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>&#8220;You know he came here to find proofs to justify
him in ordering your death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard you taunt him with it just now; but I can
protect myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not come to kill him for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I care nothing for your motives; I will not have
him killed here,&#8221; I returned in the same stern, decisive
tone.</p>

<p>She eyed me viciously, like a baulked tigress.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not?&#8221; The words came in a low, strenuous,
menacing voice that fitted with her tigress look.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I will not;&#8221; and at that, without another
word, she flung herself upon me, wrought up to such a
pitch of madness in her reckless yearning to do the deed
she had come to do upon Kolfort that she would have
plunged the knife into my heart to clear me out of her
path. She struggled with the strength and frenzy of
madness, turning the knife as I clutched and held her
wrist until it gashed my hand, while she strained every
nerve and muscle of her lithe, active body in the desperate
efforts to get past me and wrench her wrist
from my grip.</p>

<p>She was now in all truth a madwoman.</p>

<p>It was a grim, fierce, gruesome struggle, for her
strength was at all times far beyond that of a woman,
and her mania increased it until I could scarce hold
her in check. Had I been a less powerful man she
would certainly have beaten me; but I thrust her away
again, though I could not get the dagger from her, and
was preparing myself for a renewal of the struggle,
when, with a scream for help that resounded through
the house, she turned her wild eyes on me, now gleaming
with her madness, and hissed:</p>

<p>&#8220;He seeks the proofs to kill you! He shall have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
them in my dead body! My blood is on you! My
murder shall give him the proofs he needs!&#8221;</p>

<p>She cried again for help in the same ear-piercing
screech; and, before I could devise her meaning, she
turned the blade against herself, plunged it into her
own heart, and, with a last half-finished scream, fell to
the floor with a sickening thud.</p>

<p>In an instant I saw the method in her madness. The
General had seen me in the room; he was now unconscious;
there was no witness of her self-murder; my
hand was streaming with the blood from the gashes of
her knife; it was in my house it happened; her screams
for help must have been heard outside. The suggestive
proofs that I had slain her were enough to convince
anyone of my guilt, and in another moment I
should have the General&#8217;s men thundering at the door,
not only to stop my flight, but to have me denounced
as a murderer.</p>

<p>Surely never was a man in a more desperate plight,
and for the moment I knew not in my desperation
what to do.</p>

<p>A glance at General Kolfort showed me he was still
unconscious, and I rushed to him and shook him in the
frenzy of my despair. But he gave no sign of returning
consciousness, and the white face rolled from side
to side as the head shook nervelessly on the limp,
flaccid neck.</p>

<p>I clenched my hands and breathed hard in my concentrated
efforts to think coherently and form some
plan of action, and I cursed aloud in my wrath the fiend
of a woman who had brought me to this pass of peril.
I had no thought for her, dead though she was, but
wild, raging, impotent hate.</p>

<p>Mere flight was no use. If I were charged with this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
awful deed I should be proscribed as a murderer, and
the charge would dog my footsteps wherever I went
and rest on me always, till I should be dragged perhaps
to a felon&#8217;s death. These thoughts flashed like lightning
through my mind in the seconds that followed,
crazing, bewildering, and frightening me till the drops
stood cold and thick on my brow and my hands grew
clammy with the dew of fear.</p>

<p>Then came the sounds of men running on the gravel
outside, and I listened to them in positively fascinated,
helpless irresolution.</p>

<p>Another second and the men were knocking loudly
at the house door; and still I could not move. My
feet were chained by a palsy of fear to the floor, my
breath came in gasps so that I was like to choke, and
when the knocking was repeated I could do no more
than turn and stare helplessly in the direction of the
sound like a crazy idiot. My brain seemed to have
stayed every function except to fill me with this awesome
conviction of deadly inevitable peril.</p>

<p>The knocking was repeated for the third time, and I
heard the voices of the men calling to be admitted. I
felt that in a minute more the end must come, and still
I could do nothing but stare in imbecile apathy and
wait for it.</p>

<p>Never can I efface the horror of that terrible moment.</p>

<p>Then suddenly it seemed to pass. I thought clearly
again, the instincts of self-preservation reasserted themselves,
and I cursed myself for the invaluable time I
had lost.</p>

<p>But it might not even now be too late.</p>

<small>GENERAL KOLFORT TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I stood in a last second of desperate thought I
heard the crash of glass, and I knew the men were
breaking into the house; and I knew, too, that another
minute would see them in the room where I should be
caught red-handed. The instant General Kolfort returned
to consciousness he would be the first to denounce
me, despite the fact that I had saved him from
death. He would only too gladly use against me the
awful proofs of my apparent guilt which the mad
woman had afforded by her self-murder. It was just
such a chance as he would welcome.</p>

<p>I dared not leave him behind me.</p>

<p>I seized him, and, tearing with the strength of passion
at his bonds, tugged and wrenched until I freed
his hands and lifted him in my arms. He was still
faint, though I detected now the signs of returning
consciousness. Then I extinguished the light, darted
with him through the entrance into the secret passage,
and, clapping a hand over his mouth that he should
utter no sound when his senses came back, I drew my
revolver, and peering through the glass into the dark
room, stood at bay, resolved to sell my life dearly,
whatever chanced.</p>

<p>But I had secured a magnificent hostage for ultimate
freedom, could I only get through this mess. It would
all turn on what happened when the General&#8217;s men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
entered the room, and I clenched my teeth as I stared
into the darkness.</p>

<p>There was no long wait. I had barely hidden myself
when someone knocked at the door of the room,
paused for a reply, knocked again, and entered. Two
men came in, the faint light from the hall beyond showing
up their uniformed figures.</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t the room; it&#8217;s all in darkness,&#8221; said one
in a deep bass voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is; it&#8217;s the library,&#8221; said the other, who
evidently knew the house. &#8220;Are you there, General?
Did you call?&#8221;</p>

<p>They both waited for an answer, and, getting none,
came further into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be it,&#8221; said the first speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better get a light,&#8221; returned the second. &#8220;I know
it is the right room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s devilish odd.&#8221; Fumbling in his pocket,
he got a match, struck it and held it up, glancing
round the room with the faint, flickering light held
above his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a lamp,&#8221; said his companion; &#8220;hot too,
only just put out. I don&#8217;t like this. Where can the
General be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better mind what we&#8217;re doing, Loixoff. The General
won&#8217;t thank us to come shoving our noses into
his affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard the scream for help, Captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but it wasn&#8217;t the General&#8217;s voice,&#8221; returned
the Captain drily. &#8220;And he was alone with the woman
we were to take prisoner afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were lighting the lamp when this little unintentional
revelation of old Kolfort&#8217;s intended treachery
to the Countess Bokara was made.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>At that moment I felt my prisoner move, and I
pressed my hand tightly over his mouth and held him
in a grip that made my muscles like steel, lest he should
struggle, and, by the noise, bring the men upon us.</p>

<p>When they had lighted the lamp they stood looking
round them in hesitation. From where they stood the
body of the dead woman was concealed by the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;The General&#8217;s been here,&#8221; said the man who had
been addressed as Loixoff. &#8220;Here are his cap and
gloves.&#8221; They lay not far from the lamp. &#8220;What
had we better do?&#8221;</p>

<p>My prisoner made another movement then and drew
a deep breath through his nostrils, and I felt his arm
begin to writhe in my grip. I slipped my revolver into
my belt for a moment, lifted him up in my arms,
holding him like a child, put his legs between mine
while I pinioned him with my left arm so that he could
not move hand or foot, and moved my right hand up
to cover both nostrils and mouth. I would stifle his
life out of him where he lay rather than let him betray
me.</p>

<p>I could understand the men&#8217;s hesitation. Old Kolfort
was certain to resent any interference or prying
on their part into his secrets, and they foresaw that the
consequences to them might be serious if they were to
do what he did not wish. He knew how to punish interlopers.
They were afraid, and I began to hope that,
after all, I should yet get out of this plight if I could
only keep my prisoner quiet.</p>

<p>Even if I had to kill him I could still get the paper
I had come for; and as no one would know of my visit
to the house, no glint of suspicion would ever fall on
me. At this thought I almost hoped he would die.</p>

<p>The two men stood in sore perplexity for a time that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
seemed an hour to me, but may have been a couple
of minutes, and then the elder one, the Captain,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better look through the other rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; said his companion, and he turned
away while the Captain picked up the lamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;d better not try,&#8221; said Loixoff. As he
spoke he started, and I saw him stare at the spot where
the Countess lay. &#8220;By God! Captain, there&#8217;s the
woman, dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>They crossed the room together, and while the
Captain held the lamp down close to the body Loixoff
examined it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that fiend, Anna Bokara,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Now we
know what that scream meant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; here&#8217;s a knife thrust right through her heart.
There&#8217;s no pulse,&#8221; he added after a pause. &#8220;Is this
his work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be,&#8221; returned the Captain; and I saw them
look meaningly into each other&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d best clear out of this,&#8221; said the Captain.
&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s only a case of suicide after all,&#8221; he
added significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably,&#8221; was Loixoff&#8217;s dry answer as he rose
from his knees. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the General, do you
think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never think in these cases;&#8221; and the Captain put
the lamp down, taking care to find the exact spot where
it had stood, and then extinguished it. &#8220;We&#8217;ll wait
till he calls us, Loixoff. And mind, not a word that
we&#8217;ve been here. Leave the General to make his own
plans.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>They went out, closing the door softly behind them,
and I heard them leave the house. As I pushed open
the doors of the cabinet again their steps crunched on
the gravel outside as they walked away down the drive.</p>

<p>I breathed freely once more. I was safe so far, and
in the relief from the strain of the last few terrible
minutes my muscles relaxed, and I leant against the
wall with scarcely sufficient strength to prevent my
companion from slipping out of my arms to the floor.</p>

<p>But there was still much to be done, and I made a
vigorous effort to pull myself together. I relit the
lamp, but placed it so that no gleam of the light could be
seen through the windows. Then laying my prisoner,
who had fainted again as the result of my rough treatment
of him in the hiding-place, on a couch, I secured
the paper of the route I was to take to the frontier.</p>

<p>Next I applied myself vigorously to restore him to
consciousness. I dashed cold water in his face, and
then, getting brandy from a cupboard in the room, I
poured some down his throat, and bathed his forehead.
The effect was soon apparent; his breathing became
deeper and more regular, until with a deep-drawn sigh
he opened his eyes and stared at me, at first in a maze
of bewilderment, but gradually with gathering remembrance
and recognition.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do now, General; but you&#8217;ve had a near
shave. If I hadn&#8217;t come in the nick of time that
woman&#8217;s knife would have been in your heart,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>He started, and terror dilated his pupils as he glanced
wildly about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re safe from her. She&#8217;s killed herself. Drink
this;&#8221; and I gave him more brandy. As I handed it
to him he started again and stared at the blood on my
hand. He was still scared enough for my purposes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
He drank the brandy and it strengthened him, and
presently he struggled and sat up.</p>

<p>I drew out my revolver, made a show of examining
it to make sure that it was loaded, and put it back in
my pocket. I had run my hands over him before to
make certain that he had no weapon.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; he asked, with a glance
of fresh terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to use that unless you force me,&#8221; I said, with
a look which he could read easily enough. &#8220;As soon
as you&#8217;re ready to listen I&#8217;ve something to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hid his face behind his trembling hands in such
a condition of fright that I could have pitied him had
it not been necessary for me to play on his fears. He
sat like this in dead silence for some minutes, and I
waited, thinking swiftly how to carry out the plan I
had formed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you want?&#8221; he asked at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;You came here to-night to meet the Countess
Bokara in the belief that she could put into your hands
such papers as would give you an excuse to have me
put to death, and when she had done it you meant to
have had her arrested. Instead of that you fell into her
trap, and she was on the point of killing you when I
interfered and saved your life. Then she turned on me
and struggled to kill me in order that she might carry
out her purpose. Her failure drove her insane, and in
her frenzy of baulked revenge she plunged the knife
into her own heart. You will therefore write out a
statement of these facts while they are still fresh in
your mind, sign it, and give it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pointed to my table, on which I had laid the writing
materials in readiness. He was fast recovering his
wits, if not his courage, and he listened intently as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
spoke. I saw a look of cunning pass over his face as
he agreed to what I said, and crossed to the writing-table.
He thought he could easily disown the statement,
and had been quick to perceive the use he could
make of the facts against me. But he did not know
the further plan I had, and he wrote out a clear statement
exactly as I had required.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seal it with your private seal,&#8221; I said when he had
signed it, his handwriting throughout having been purposely
shaky. He would have demurred, but I soon
convinced him I was in no mood to be fooled with.
&#8220;Your seal can&#8217;t be disowned as a forgery,&#8221; I said
pointedly. &#8220;And now, as your hand has recovered its
steadiness, you can write this again&mdash;this time, if you
please, so that no one can mistake it;&#8221; and while he
did this I watched him closely to prevent a similar trick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; I exclaimed when all was finished. The
second paper he had written I folded up carefully and
placed in my pocket; the first I laid inside the dress of
the dead woman, in such a position that anyone finding
the body must see the paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will explain what has happened when the
body is found,&#8221; I said drily. &#8220;I want the facts made
very plain.&#8221; He looked at me with an expression of
hate and fear and cunning combined.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go; I am not well,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going together, General,&#8221; I returned
quietly. &#8220;I am willing to assume that you are so
grateful to me for having saved your life, that in turn
you wish to secure my safety. You have had me
arrested once, your men have treated me like a felon,
you have filled the roads with your agents until I cannot
take a step without further fear of instant capture, and
up to this moment you have sought my life with tireless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
energy; but now you are so concerned for my safety,
so eager to repair your mistaken estimate of me, and
heedful for my welfare, that you are going to see me
safe to the Servian frontier. That is the part you are
cast for; and, listen to me, if you refuse, if you give so
much as a sign or suggestion of treachery, if you don&#8217;t
play that part to the letter, I swear by all I hold
sacred I&#8217;ll scatter your brains with this pistol;&#8221; and I
clapped it to his head till the cold steel pressed a ring
on his temple. &#8220;Now what do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>He cowered and shrank at my desperate words, and
all the horror and fright of death with which the
Countess Bokara had filled his soul came back upon
him again as he stared helplessly up at me. His dry
bloodless lips moved, but no sound passed them; he
lifted his hands as if in entreaty, only to drop them
again in feeble nervelessness; and he shook and trembled
like one stricken with sudden ague.</p>

<p>&#8220;You value your life, I see, and you can earn it in
the way I&#8217;ve said. So long as I am safe you will be
safe, and not one second longer. That I swear. If
there is danger on the road for me it is your making,
and you shall taste of the risks you order so glibly for
others. Every hazard that waits there for me will be
one for you as well. You are dealing with a man you
have rendered utterly reckless and desperate. Remember
that. Now, do you agree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything,&#8221; he whispered, in so low a tone that I
could only catch it with difficulty.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_320.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;THE COLD STEEL PRESSED A RING ON HIS TEMPLE.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Page <a href="#Page_320">320</a>.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll make a start. Come first with me.&#8221; I
led him upstairs to my dressing-room, and made him
wait while I exchanged the uniform I was wearing for
a civilian&#8217;s dress, and shaved off my beard and moustache.
He sat watching me in dead silence, his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
following my every action, much like a man spellbound
and fascinated. I had saturated him through and
through with fear of me, till his very brain was dizzy
and dimmed with terror.</p>

<p>When my hasty preparations were finished, I took
him down to the shooting gallery while I armed myself
with a stout sword-stick of the highest temper, testing
the blade before him, and took a plentiful supply of
ammunition for my revolver. I kept absolute silence
the whole time, letting the looks which I now and again
cast on him tell their own story of my implacable resolve.
He was like a weak woman in his dread of me,
and at every fierce glance of mine he started with a
fresh access of terror.</p>

<p>When all was ready for my start, I drew the plan of
my route from my pocket and studied it carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready,&#8221; I said; &#8220;and now mark me. You
will call up one of your men. What is that Captain&#8217;s
name who is here with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Berschoff,&#8221; he answered, like a child saying a lesson.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will call up Captain Berschoff and order him
to draw off his men, and to send your carriage, unattended,
mind, up to the front door. You will be careful
that the Captain does not see me. When the
carriage comes, you will order your coachman to drive
you as fast as he can travel to the village of Kutscherf.
While you are speaking to Captain Berschoff my hand
will be on your shoulder and my revolver at your head,
and if you dare to falter in so much as a word or syllable
of what I have told you, that moment will be your
last on earth. Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>I held my revolver in hand as we left the gallery and
went to the door of the house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>My breath came quickly in my fast-growing excitement,
for I knew that a moment would bring the crisis
on the issue of which all would turn. When once I
had got rid of his men, his sense of helplessness would
be complete, and my task would be lighter. But my
fear was that in his cunning he might even dare to play
me false in the belief that I should be afraid to make
my threat good. He knew as well as I that to shoot
him right in front of his captain would be an act fraught
with consummate peril for me.</p>

<p>My heart beat fast as I unfastened the heavy door,
opened it, and turning gripped him by the shoulder as
he went forward on to the step and called to Captain
Berschoff.</p>

<p>Then I pulled him back, closed the door to within a
couple of inches, and, planting my foot to prevent it
being opened wider, I pressed the barrel of the pistol
to his head, as we stood listening to the hurried footsteps
of the approaching officer.</p>

<small>THE PUSH FOR THE FRONTIER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Did</span> you call, General?&#8221; asked the captain; and as
the voice came through the door I tightened the grip
on my prisoner and pressed the barrel of the revolver
harder against his head.</p>

<p>He hesitated, and when no answer was given the
question was repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Kolfort, in an unsteady tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I come in? Is anything the matter?&#8221; and I
felt the door pushed from the outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; in the same unsteady tone. &#8220;No, I&mdash;I do not
need you. You will take your men back to my house
and&mdash;and wait for instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the prisoner, General? Shall we take her
with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him she has killed herself,&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no prisoner to take, Captain Berschoff.
She has&mdash;has taken her own life. Leave that to me.
Withdraw your men and send my carriage up to the
door here for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, General. Is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s all.&#8221; The words came with a sigh of
relief. I shut the door immediately, and we stood in
the dark, near the window which the two officers had
broken to get into the house, and listened as the captain
walked quickly to the gates. Then came a word
of command, followed by the scraping of the carriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
wheels on the drive, and the sounds of the soldiers&#8217;
horses and the rattle of their accoutrements as they
wheeled away along the road.</p>

<p>So far all was going well, and the crisis I feared had
passed safely. The carriage drew up outside the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember where to tell him to drive, Kutscherf,&#8221;
I said sternly. &#8220;You have half earned your life, but
you must go through with it.&#8221; I opened the door,
linked my arm in his, and led him down the steps, and
together we entered the carriage. He gave his order
to the coachman through the window, and a moment
later we started, turned out of the gates, and rattled
along at a brave pace for the frontier.</p>

<p>General Kolfort fell back on the seat and pressed his
hands to his face, as though dizzy and weak with the
long tension of fear, and partly, I judged, ashamed of
himself for his cowardice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better try to sleep, General,&#8221; I said; &#8220;we
have a long drive. I shall be on watch, and shall not
need to disturb you unless we stumble across any of
your troublesome patrols.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was indeed my one source of fear now, and I
leant back thinking how we should deal with them in
the event of interference. The General&#8217;s presence
would probably make everything smooth enough, but
there was always a chance that an opportunity would
be given for him to try some trick to elude me.</p>

<p>We had at least sixty miles to drive, and as it was
now past midnight I reckoned we could not reach the
frontier until between seven and eight in the morning.
It would be sunrise by five, and there would be thus
at least two or three hours to drive in daylight. That
would be the time of chief danger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>It was a bright, fine night, the moon had risen, and
when we had cleared the town I resolved to urge the
driver to quicken the pace of his horses. I let down
the window, and the cool night air came rushing in
and roused my companion, who sat up quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing; I wish your man to travel faster.&#8221; I leant
out and called to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;The General says you are to drive faster; at a gallop
where possible.&#8221; He did not hear me at first, and
was for checking the horses, until I shouted the order
to him again. I drew in my head, and was only just in
the nick of time to avoid trouble.</p>

<p>The General had opened the door on his side and,
in his desperation, was in the very act of springing out.
I caught hold of him, dragged him back, and shut the
door again. He fell in a heap huddled up at my feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;A very dangerous leap for a man of your age,&#8221; I
said drily. &#8220;I have probably saved your life, for the
second time to-night,&#8221; and I lifted him up on to the
seat of the carriage again. &#8220;And now, understand me,
if you had got out, I would have sprung out after you
and shot you in the highway, had it cost me my life.
I thought that you would understand by now that I&#8217;m
in too dangerous a mood for you to fool with. But
I&#8217;m glad of the hint you&#8217;ve given me, and I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t forget
it for the rest of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made no answer, but lay back on the seat as before,
and I did not attempt to rouse him. The incident
disquieted me, for it showed that he was dead
set on outwitting me, and would do so if I relaxed for
a single second the strain of his terror of my pistol.</p>

<p>The carriage was now travelling at a great pace, the
man urging the horses to a gallop over every yard of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
level road. We reached the first village without further
incident, and I told the man where to get the
change of horses. There was a little delay in rousing
the people of the place, but once roused they set to
work with a will, and in a very few minutes we were
spinning on again with the fresh cattle at the same high
speed for the next stage.</p>

<p>Markov had done his work shrewdly, and had
planned the route so that for the greater part of the
way we travelled without having to use the main road.
But the by-ways were rough going in many places, and
this retarded our progress. We made good time, however,
and when we changed horses for the second,
third, and fourth times without being stopped, my
hopes began to rise fast that we might even reach the
frontier unchallenged. We had covered over forty
miles, and yet, including the time spent in changing
horses, we had barely been four hours on the road.</p>

<p>A check came soon after the fourth change, however.
We had to take to the main road, and had covered some
two or three miles, when I heard a shout and felt the
carriage checked suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221; called someone, and looking
out I saw we were in the midst of a strong patrol.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not stop us. I&#8217;m driving express.
It&#8217;s General Kolfort,&#8221; came the coachman&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>I caught my breath, and my prisoner roused himself
instantly and sat up. I passed my arm round him and,
pressing the revolver against his ribs over his heart
from behind, I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You will tell these men to allow us to pass. My
pistol is within an inch of your heart, and my finger
on the trigger.&#8221; I felt him shudder. &#8220;Let that window
down, and call to them angrily. You know me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>He let it down, fumbling clumsily, so that with my
disengaged hand I had to help him.</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officer in charge of the patrol
had dismounted and came to the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by stopping me? Don&#8217;t you
know who I am, blockhead?&#8221; cried the General, his
teeth chattering with chill and fright.</p>

<p>&#8220;My orders are imperative, to stop all travellers and
see their papers,&#8221; replied the man as he saluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve stopped us; that&#8217;s enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see your papers, if you please,&#8221; he said
stolidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose the General writes passes for himself,&#8221;
I broke in.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no papers,&#8221; cried the General sharply. I
saw his motive; he wished to provoke the man to stop
us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you will have to alight,&#8221; said the soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. I suppose there&#8217;s no help for it;&#8221; and
as he turned to me the General&#8217;s face wore an expression
half defiant, half cunning. &#8220;I&#8217;m not responsible
for what these blockheads do,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What papers do you want?&#8221; I asked, at a loss
quite what to do in this new and perplexing turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;All travellers this way must carry a permit, or
they are to be stopped. Those are my orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely you know General Kolfort?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see the permit,&#8221; he answered doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easily managed. You can write one, General.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must be signed and countersigned,&#8221; he returned,
with growing suspicion and rising anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fellow&#8217;s right,&#8221; said the General, turning to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
me with a laugh. &#8220;It&#8217;s absurd, but he&#8217;s right.&#8221; His
manner enraged me. He was trying all he dared to
play into the man&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only obeying orders,&#8221; said the sergeant;
and for a moment it seemed as if between them I
should be fooled. But I knew well enough what
short work my prisoner would have made of such an
interruption under other circumstances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you tell me you don&#8217;t know that this is General
Kolfort?&#8221; I asked very sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not here to study faces, sir, but to examine
permits,&#8221; was the blunt blockhead&#8217;s answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can at least read, then? And I presume you
know the General&#8217;s handwriting. You shall have an
order signed by the General, and one which will need
no countersign to ensure its being obeyed. What&#8217;s
your name and regiment? Quick!&#8221; I said in a short
tone of command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Max Pullschoff, sergeant, 3rd Regiment, 2nd Army
Corps,&#8221; he answered saluting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, General, order him to allow us to proceed at
once at his peril. This fooling has gone far enough,&#8221;
and I enforced my words with a look of menace, while
I pressed the revolver hard against his ribs, and added
in a whisper, &#8220;Instantly!&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated just one instant, trying to nerve himself
to defy me, but it was only for the instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am General Kolfort, and I order you at your peril
to delay me no longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, sir, but my orders are absolute.
I can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Write an order to Captain Berschoff that the rascal
has mutinied against your authority, General, and that
instantly on his return to quarters he is to be imprisoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
and flogged for mutiny. We will see then what he
says about signatures,&#8221; and I took out my pocket-book
and gave it him with a pencil.</p>

<p>He glared at me viciously, but the revolver was his
master, and he wrote out the order just as I had bade
him, and signed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Sergeant Pullschoff, read that, and say
whether in the face of it you venture to carry this
thing further.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man took it, and I saw his face turn deadly white
as he read it and scanned the signature closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done no more than my duty, General,&#8221; he
murmured; but I saw that I had beaten him, and I
pressed that advantage home.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you detain us a minute longer, my man, you
will go galloping back to Sofia in custody for that order
to be executed. You and your men know perfectly
well that this is General Kolfort, and that this is his
carriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped away from the carriage window, and I
saw him consult with a couple of his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I break my orders you will hold me harmless,
General?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we shall. Tell him so, General.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented the latter, but very slowly and regretfully,
for the new turn of the matter was all against
his wishes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can give me back that order,&#8221; I said then.
&#8220;And I shall make it my business to see that you are
commended for your care in carrying out your instructions.
Tell the coachman to drive on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir. I wish to do no more,&#8221; said the
fellow, saluting, as he handed me the paper, and then
called to the driver to proceed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>&#8220;A very excellent soldier that, very wooden, but
human at bottom in his fear for himself,&#8221; I said quietly
to my prisoner, as we passed the last of the patrols,
who all saluted us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curse you!&#8221; cried the General, in the bitterness of
his chagrin and disappointment.</p>

<p>I laughed; I could afford to now that the danger
was passed; and my satisfaction was the more genuine
because the danger had been more serious than I had
anticipated. Moreover, it suggested to me to take a precaution
which I had neglected before starting.</p>

<p>When we drew up for the next change of horses I
made my prisoner write me a formal permit to pass all
patrols, as being on special service, and I pocketed it
for use in case of need. The value of it I had an opportunity
of testing within a few minutes, for we
were stopped again by another patrol of troops. But
I produced the permit this time, and it was accepted
without a word of comment.</p>

<p>It was now daylight; and, as we drew near the frontier,
my excitement increased. When we changed
horses for the last time my spirits were as high as my
companion&#8217;s rage and chagrin were manifest.</p>

<p>In less than an hour I should be across the frontier
if all went well; and all had gone so well that it would
be a mere superfluity of cowardice to anticipate any
serious obstacle now. We had left the main road, and
had travelled some four miles through rough hilly cross
lanes to the point where Markov had planned for the
frontier to be crossed, when I found that the driver
was in trouble with the horses. They were going very
erratically, now jibbing and plunging in the harness,
and again dashing forward at headlong speed. While
they galloped I cared nothing, and, though we bumped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
over the rough roads so violently that my companion
could scarcely keep on his seat, and was constantly
thrown against me, I was well contented, and laughed.
The greater the speed the better it pleased me. But
when they stopped, and plunged, and kicked with a
violence quite beyond the man&#8217;s power to control, I
was anxious enough.</p>

<p>Then, quite suddenly, came an overwhelming disaster
which ruined everything. We had ascended a
steep hill at a slow pace, with more than one stoppage,
and were descending a slope on the other side, when
the horses bolted, and dashed away down it with a
frantic fury that threatened to smash us up at almost
every stride. The pace was mad enough to frighten a
man whose nerves were in far better order than those
of my fright-wrought prisoner, and his terror paralysed
him.</p>

<p>There was going to be a smash; and I had scarcely
time to realise the certainty of it, and to wonder
vaguely how it would affect my escape, when it came.
There were a few moments of mad, jolting, dizzying
rush down the hill, then a fearful crash as the wheels
struck against some heavy obstacle, a wild jerk that
threw us both forward in a heap, a noise of smashing
glass and rending woodwork, half-a-dozen great lurching
bumps and jolts, and the carriage was on its side,
dragging, and tearing, and grinding on the rough road,
till it stopped, and I found myself lying in its ruins,
with my hands and face badly cut and bruised, and
every bone in my body, as it seemed, either broken or
dislocated. I struggled out of the ruin as best I could,
to find the driver and his horses in a heap in the road,
the man himself in imminent peril of being kicked to
death. I managed to haul him out of danger, and laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
him by the roadside unconscious from the effect of his
fall, and left the horses to fight it out for themselves
while I looked after General Kolfort.</p>

<p>He was also unconscious; but whether from hurt or
fear I could not tell. He lay pinned underneath the
carriage, and I had great difficulty in releasing him.
But I got him out, and set him beside the coachman,
just as one of the horses succeeded in kicking himself
free, struggled to his feet, and began backing and tugging
to break the reins. I ran to him, patted and
soothed him, and then, cutting the reins, I knotted
them and fastened him to a tree. I meant him to
carry me to the frontier on his back, and was glad to
find, when I ran my hands over him, that he had no
more serious hurts than a few surface cuts.</p>

<p>But I was in truth vastly puzzled how to act. To
take the General with me any further was impossible;
yet to leave him behind might be infinitely dangerous.
The instant he recovered consciousness he would set
all his wits and malice to work to have me followed;
and my perplexity was vastly increased when I saw
about a mile ahead of me a couple of horse-patrols appear
on the crest of a hill, and come riding leisurely
toward us.</p>

<p>There was no time for hesitation. I realised instantly
the impossibility of holding the General in my
power by means of threats in the presence of a couple
of soldiers in broad daylight. There was infinitely less
danger in trusting to flight.</p>

<p>I rushed to the horse, therefore, unfastened him,
leapt on his bare back, and set off at a gallop to meet
the approaching soldiers. As I glanced back I saw to
my dismay that the General had been fooling me with
a sham fainting fit, for he had risen to a sitting posture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
and was endeavouring to shake the coachman back to
his senses.</p>

<p>At this I urged my horse forward, for I knew his
next step would be to try and make the soldiers understand
that I was to be stopped and secured.</p>

<p>As I galloped I made my plans. Getting within
earshot, I called to them to hasten forward, for they
had halted, and stood with their carbines ready to stop
me.</p>

<p>Reining my horse up as best I could, I said, in a tone
of command:</p>

<p>&#8220;General Kolfort has met with an accident there,
and you are to hasten to his assistance instantly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, if you please, sir. Have you your
papers?&#8221; asked one of the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I have. I am riding on special service.
Here is my permit;&#8221; and I showed it to him, not letting
it out of my hands, however. He pushed his
horse forward and read it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems all right,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s all right. I am on a matter of life or
death, and have to press forward with all speed. I
have had to use one of the carriage horses; but one of
you had better give me yours. It is an urgent affair
of State.&#8221;</p>

<p>My tone of authority, added to the permit of urgency
with the General&#8217;s signature, impressed him considerably.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all against orders,&#8221; he said, hesitating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose this won&#8217;t justify everything?&#8221; I
cried, shaking the General&#8217;s order in his face. &#8220;You
may find it awkward to refuse. The General will soon
put you right. Quick! there&#8217;s no time to lose;&#8221; and,
to act my part thoroughly, I slipped off my horse.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>He dismounted slowly, and half reluctantly; but the
instant his foot touched the ground, I let my horse
loose, and, giving him a thrust in the ribs, sent him
trotting down the road, while I seized the bridle of the
other and swung into the saddle, before the man had
recovered from his astonishment.</p>

<p>Then an exclamation from the second soldier attracted
the attention of us both. There was good
cause; for, on looking back, I saw that three other
horse-soldiers had joined the General, who was making
frantic gesticulations to the men with me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! he sees me stopping, and wishes me to push
on,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you had better ride back with us, if you
please,&#8221; said the soldier who had dismounted, and he
made a sign to his companion, who was still barring
my path, to stop me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, he wishes me to push on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you proceed, sir, order or no order,&#8221; he
answered bluntly, and made as if to seize my horse&#8217;s
bridle, while he ordered his subordinate to prevent
my passing.</p>

<p>At the same moment the men with the General fired
their carbines to call our attention, and set off towards
us at full gallop.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least you can wait till those men reach us,&#8221; he
said, and his tone and face showed his suspicions that
something was wrong.</p>

<p>Thus in a moment the position had developed into
one of fresh embarrassment and imminent peril for me.</p>

<small>THE RUINED HUT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two soldiers mistook me vastly if they thought
I was going to allow myself to be caught in this way
like a rat in a trap, when the trap was a mile long, and
the door of it guarded so loosely.</p>

<p>I had backed my horse to prevent the man on foot
catching hold of the bridle-rein, and, wheeling round
swiftly, I plunged my hand into my pocket, drew out
my revolver, and, before the second soldier could guess
my intention, I sent a bullet into his horse&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>He dropped like a stone, sending his rider flying on
to the road, his carbine, which he had levelled at me,
going off in the air as he fell. The other made a rush
at me, but I covered him with the pistol.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you try to stop me on State business?&#8221;
I cried in a voice of thunder. &#8220;Another step and I&#8217;ll
blow your brains out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pulled up short enough at that, and I clapped my
heels into the horse&#8217;s flanks, and was off like the wind.
He was a good beast, in excellent condition and very
fresh, and more than fit to carry me the six miles which
I reckoned lay between me and the frontier. The distance
was so short that I had no need to spare him,
and, as I had over three-quarters of a mile start, I did
not doubt that I could win a race in which my safety
and probably my life were the stakes.</p>

<p>I was in luck, too, for the soldier before dismounting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
had thrust back his carbine into its leathern shoe, and
in among his saddle-furniture I found a reserve supply
of ammunition.</p>

<p>Turning in my saddle I saw that the three soldiers
had passed the two with whom I had had the tussle,
and were galloping after me at full speed, striving might
and main to lessen the distance between us, and I knew,
of course, that old Kolfort had given them his most
imperative command to overtake and capture me at
all costs.</p>

<p>But a few minutes of this hot work showed me that
I was better mounted than they, and that I was gaining.
They perceived this, too, and resorted to a tactic
which gave me some uneasiness. One after another
they began firing their carbines, not of course at me,
for I was hopelessly out of range, but in the hope of
attracting any other patrol parties who might chance
to be in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>This was by no means to my taste. It suggested
that they knew there were more troops about, and while
I dug my heels into my willing horse&#8217;s sides, and urged
him with my voice to still greater speed, I cast ahead
many anxious looks.</p>

<p>A minute later, too, I was thrown into a state of
much perplexity as to my road. About half a mile in
front the road forked, and I did not know whether my
way lay to the right or left, and had no time to consult
the plan of route. It would have been fatal to hesitate,
however, and I was going to leave my horse to settle
the matter for himself, trusting that he might have been
stabled somewhere near the frontier and would thus
make for that point, when a very disquieting fact
decided me.</p>

<p>A couple of troopers were riding at a quick trot along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
the road to the left, and coming in my direction. They
were at a considerable distance, and I should reach the
junction long before them. I determined to trust to
fortune and take the other road.</p>

<p>They soon caught sight of me, and as the men pursuing
me kept up their fire, the two in front hustled
their horses into a gallop, evidently thinking something
was wrong, and intending to cut me off and stop
me.</p>

<p>They saw me turn into the right road, checked their
horses, leapt into the fields, and came galloping across
to intercept me. This was not practicable, however,
because the point for which they were making was
nearer to me by the road than to them by the fields,
and after they had galloped half across the fields they
called to me to stop. Perceiving my advantage, my
answer was to urge my horse forward, till he was
straining every nerve and flying over the ground like
the gallant beast he was.</p>

<p>Then one of them reined up suddenly, and being well
within range, he sat as steady as a rock on his horse,
levelled his piece, and fired. Fortunately for me he
was quite as bad a marksman as the majority of such
men are, and the bullet whistled harmlessly by me as I
dashed past at the same headlong speed. His companion
had, however, come much nearer, and when he
found he could not intercept me, he too halted and fired
after me in his turn.</p>

<p>He also missed me, but I felt my horse give a violent
change in his stride, and immediately begin to slacken
speed. I looked around anxiously and found, to my
intense alarm and consternation, that he was wounded,
and had gone dead lame on his off hind leg.</p>

<p>For the first time I was inclined to despair. Behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
me were five well-mounted men eagerly bent on my
capture, and before me lay at least three miles of
unknown road&mdash;even supposing that I was riding in the
right direction&mdash;while my horse was already beginning
to stagger in his stride. But my blood was up. I
would not be taken alive, and I resolved to fight so
long as I could lift a finger in self-defence.</p>

<p>Flight was now out of the question, however.
Wounded as he was, my horse could not have carried
me to the frontier had I been able to ease his pace,
which was of course impossible. I could fight better
on foot than on the back of a wounded horse, moreover,
and I began to think desperately of my best
course.</p>

<p>I drew out the trooper&#8217;s carbine, put the ammunition
into my pockets, and looked about for the most
likely spot for a last stand. About half a mile ahead
of me I spied a peasant&#8217;s cottage half in ruins, lying a
little distance from the lane. Just the place for me!
I urged my horse to the last effort, and he answered
gallantly, as if he understood how dire was my need.
But he was reeling badly when we reached the spot I
was heading for; and the two men behind raised a glad
shout as they saw me pull up, slip from the horse, and
make a dash, carbine in hand, for the cover of the
ruined cottage.</p>

<p>They both fired at me as I ran, a cowardly act that
filled me with rage. Hitherto I had tried to avoid
shedding blood, but I sent that thought to the winds
now as I sprang behind the shelter of the welcome
walls and turned to settle accounts with them. Armed
as I was, I believed I could for a time hold the place
against a party twice as strong as that which was
coming against me, and I was so mad in my rage and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
disappointment, that I swore I would shoot without
mercy any living soul that came within range.</p>

<p>The two soldiers came galloping up to the point
where my horse had now fallen, and they stood chuckling
at the successful shot which had wounded him.</p>

<p>I singled out one of them&mdash;the man who, as I
thought, had fired the fatal shot&mdash;took deliberate aim,
and fired. He dropped like a stone, and his companion
turned instantly and scuttled back to meet the other
three, who were now closing up fast. I smiled grimly
as I thrust in another cartridge, and was turning to
look for the next quarry when my heart gave another
throb of dismay.</p>

<p>The place seemed alive with troops; and I saw
another horseman coming from the opposite direction
along the lane towards the cottage, and I did not
doubt that he was the advance guard of a stronger
patrol following behind.</p>

<p>The four men had halted out of range and were
talking excitedly together, and I was thus at liberty to
watch the newcomer, whose movements puzzled me
considerably. When he heard the shot from my gun,
and probably saw the smoke, instead of dashing forward
to join the men threatening me, or falling back
upon any party behind, he scuttled off the road and
concealed himself in a small clump of trees, from
which he seemed to be scanning the cottage where I
lay. No trooper out on patrol would have acted so,
and I concluded promptly that he was in some such
condition as myself, and as eager as I to escape the
attentions of the soldiers.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that he was a friend? The
mere thought of such a chance in my desperate position
filled me with excited pleasure, and, stepping forward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
I stood so that the sun&#8217;s rays fell right on me as
I faced him, and I waved my hand. I thought he
made some motion with his hand in reply, but he stood
in the shadow of the trees, and was too far off for me
to see him clearly. Then I waved my hand again,
beckoning him to come to me, and had time to do no
more before the four soldiers began to move, and I
had to step back under shelter and watch them.</p>

<p>Apparently they had resolved to make a dash for the
cottage, in the endeavour to capture me with a rush.
But they should never reach the place alive. I calculated
that I should have time for two shots with the
carbine and half-a-dozen more with my revolver, and if
I could not empty the four saddles my hand and eye
and nerve had lost their cunning indeed.</p>

<p>They crossed into the field, and seeing that there
were no windows in the end of the building from which
I could fire upon them, they kept out of range until
they were in a line with the end, and then began their
advance. A shrewd enough plan, had I been a fool to
be caught unawares, or a coward afraid to expose myself
to their rickety fire. But I was neither, and creeping
out at the front I was in a position to take a kneeling
shot at them before they started the advance. I
don&#8217;t think they even saw me, for there was a relic of
what had once been a palisade projecting from the end
of the house, which gave an excellent cover, and I
waited till they were well within range before I fired.
One of them fell forward, and I had reloaded and was
taking careful aim for my second shot, when with a
loud shout they pulled up hastily and made ready to
fire in their turn.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t give them time to shoot before I fired again,
and again brought one of them out of his saddle. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
reduced the number to two, and neither of them had
any relish for the business. They discharged their
pieces at random, wheeled about suddenly, and galloped
back faster than they had advanced. I had
given them an excellent object-lesson in the value of
good shooting, and I stood watching them in moody
curiosity to see what they would do next.</p>

<p>Then I heard the sound of a galloping horse from
the other end of the cottage, and when I ran back
quickly to learn the cause I had indeed a joyful surprise.
It was the horseman I had seen in the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Took you in the rear, Count,&#8221; said a deep voice I
knew so well; and the next instant Zoiloff and I stood
hand-locked, his stern face aglow with pleasure and
I with more delight in my heart than either words
or eyes could tell. Never could a friend have been
so welcome, and none more welcome than Zoiloff. I
was so moved that I could not even find words to
ask the news which I was burning to learn. He saw
this, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;All is well with the Princess. She is safe at Nish,
waiting for you.&#8221; I wrung his hand afresh in my delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never did beleaguered force hear better news,&#8221; I
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The beleaguered force is doubled now,&#8221; he answered,
smiling. &#8220;Though I can&#8217;t say it seems to
need strengthening, judging by results. But now we
had best be off, for the country between here and the
frontier is like a rabbit-warren with the swarming
troops. We shall probably have to hide, for we can&#8217;t
hold this place till nightfall, and I very much doubt if
we can get through the pass in daylight.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>&#8220;I have a permit that will carry us through,&#8221; I said;
&#8220;but I have no horse to carry it on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll soon mend that,&#8221; he answered, and without a
word he mounted again and set off at a gallop toward
the two soldiers, who stood together holding the horses
of their wounded comrades by the bridles. What
followed was a gleam of farce in the tragedy that surrounded
us. The men seeing him coming were instantly
filled with alarm, for my work had told its tale
well enough on their nerves, and after making a show
of resistance and firing their carbines at him with
scarcely a pretence of taking aim, they plunged their
spurs into their animals and shot away trying to lead
the other horses with them. But Zoiloff gained at
every stride, and when he fired his revolver after them
they cast off the led horses and themselves fled for
their lives in sheer scatterbrained fright. He had no
difficulty in capturing one of the horses, and came
cantering back to me smiling and victorious.</p>

<p>&#8220;What rabbits,&#8221; he said contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a happy thought of yours,&#8221; I replied, as I
mounted, and we stole off, keeping the cottage between
us and the still flying soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we make a dash for it and risk everything;
or shall we try and hide? Those curs will soon be
after us with a larger pack in full cry, and we may find
it difficult to hide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll push straight for the frontier,&#8221; I answered,
&#8220;and trust to old Kolfort&#8217;s signature to get us through.
The patrols seem to be in very small numbers, and if
there&#8217;s any trouble we can show fight. But now tell
me what has happened, for I am on fire with impatience
to hear everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happily there&#8217;s little enough to tell, for by some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
means we managed to escape all interference, and under
your fellow Markov&#8217;s guidance we reached the frontier
without let or question. There was plenty of uneasiness
after we left you as to whether we should be pursued;
but thanks, I suppose, to your ruse, we were not
followed, and the only trouble afterwards was in the
frontier pass. It was only watched in the loosest manner
in the world, and as Markov knew his business
thoroughly he had us all past the lookout before they
had even a suspicion of our presence. It was only a
matter of a quick gallop then for a bit and we got
through. I went on to Nish with the Princess, who
was much fatigued of course, and it was at her urgent
request, when you did not come yesterday, that I returned
to see if I could hear any tidings of you. My
uniform saved me from any trouble, and I was intending
to go to Sofia, when I heard the firing and stopped
to see what it meant, I saw you stand out in the sun
glare just now, and though I could not definitely recognise
you at such a distance I made a guess it was
you, and rode up on the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You left the Princess well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In all save her anxiety for you; and that we may
hope to remove in a few hours now. But how have
you fared?&#8221;</p>

<p>I told him the story, and he listened with many an
approving smile and nod, looking stern and serious at
the story of the Countess Bokara&#8217;s suicide, and laughing
at the trick I had served old Kolfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all that, we are not going to be stopped
now,&#8221; he said at the close; &#8220;although we shall have
need of clear heads and perhaps quick hands before we
are through. But we shall know soon. You see that
narrow road climbing the hill yonder, with that small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
station-house about half-way up. Well, the frontier
line runs close ahead of that;&#8221; and he pointed to the
spot. &#8220;Hullo! who comes?&#8221; he added a minute later,
as we turned a bend of the road and came upon two
or three horse-soldiers.</p>

<p>We were riding at a brisk canter, and did not rein
up until they challenged us. Seeing Zoiloff&#8217;s uniform
they saluted him, but the leader turned to me and
asked for my permit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am on special service,&#8221; I said quietly, producing
the permit. He read it, returned it to me, drew back
for us to proceed, and we cantered on without having
wasted a minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had your wits about you when you got that
paper,&#8221; said Zoiloff, laughing. &#8220;If those fellows had
only known what that special service was, we should
have had a brush with them. Let&#8217;s hope that those
at the barrier will be as easily satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a nasty-looking road,&#8221; said I, when we reached
the foot of the long tortuous hill. &#8220;We&#8217;d better spare
the cattle in case of a bother,&#8221; and we pulled up to a
walking pace. I scanned the station-house closely as
we came in sight of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to Heaven it was night. We could steal up
that path there,&#8221; said Zoiloff, pointing to the right of
the road. &#8220;That&#8217;s how Markov managed it. It leads
out again about twenty or thirty yards on this side of
the station-house yonder, and we rattled through at a
gallop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many men are stationed there, do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t see more than half-a-dozen or so all told
this morning when I passed, and I stopped intentionally
and chatted with the officer in command. But in
a narrow place like this six men can do a lot.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>&#8220;I see there&#8217;s a telegraph-wire. I hope the General
hasn&#8217;t managed to send a message,&#8221; I returned uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think not, judging by the ease with which
those men below there were satisfied. But I mean to
get through. Once past the station-house, and we
haven&#8217;t more than two or three hundred yards to gallop
before we&#8217;re in Servia. But I confess I never thought
of the telegraph,&#8221; and Zoiloff shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll try the papers first and the pistols afterwards,
in case of need. And they won&#8217;t find it easy
to stop us.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as we drew closer I saw what Zoiloff meant
about the ease with which a handful of resolute men
could hold such a spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve turned out to receive us,&#8221; he said, as we
saw an officer posting men to block the road. &#8220;He
won&#8217;t attempt to stop me, I expect, and while you&#8217;re
showing him your permit I&#8217;ll edge past and try to get
the men out of their order so as to leave a gap for you
to dash through. Then I&#8217;ll follow you, and they may
hesitate about firing on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; but we can&#8217;t make much of a plan.
Probably I may find it best to appear to yield at first
and then wait for the moment to make the rush;&#8221; and
with that we rode on slowly, watching the men ahead
of us closely, but laughing and chatting together as
though the last thought in our heads was of any chance
of being stopped. And we were both laughing heartily
as at some joke when the officer in command met
Zoiloff with a salute and turned to address me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your permit, sir, if you please,&#8221; he said courteously,
but as I thought with a glance of suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; I replied, and I took it out and handed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
it to him. As he read it Zoiloff pushed forward and
entered into conversation with the men. There were
only five of them, making six with the officer, as Zoiloff
had said, and they were on foot. I saw him push his
horse between the two at the end of the short line, and
then as he chatted he coolly turned his horse broadside
on the road, thus making a big gap. It was
cleverly done, and he sat there saying something which
made the men laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;This mentions no name, sir,&#8221; said the officer, looking
up from the paper. &#8220;May I inquire your
name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. I am the Hon. Gerald Winthrop, an
Englishman.&#8221; The reply perplexed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;An Englishman? And on special service for General
Kolfort? I don&#8217;t wish to appear impertinent, but
have you another name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am also a Roumanian Count&mdash;Count Benderoff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; His tone told me at once that he had had
some instructions about me, and I began to prepare
for emergencies. &#8220;I am placed in an awkward position,
Count, but I&#8217;m afraid I cannot allow you to
pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My business is very urgent, lieutenant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The delay will probably be only a brief one. I am
expecting a messenger from General Kolfort, and I
thought you were probably from him. No doubt the
moment he arrives you will be at liberty to proceed.
But you&#8217;ll understand my position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The consequences of stopping me may be serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So may be those of allowing you to pass, Count.
But in any case I have no alternative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have ridden straight from General Kolfort
himself, who handed me the permit personally.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>&#8220;My instructions have come over the wires, and
within the last few minutes; and they are imperative
not to allow you to pass until the General himself or
those he is sending shall arrive. If you will dismount
I will try to make the delay as little irksome as possible,
though one&#8217;s resources in a God-forsaken place like this
are not abundant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean you wish to arrest me?&#8221; I asked
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. You are at liberty to return if you
please; my instructions are merely not to allow you
to pass the frontier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quiet, mare!&#8221; I called to my horse, which was
fidgeting and plunging restlessly, as I touched her
secretly with my heel, making it difficult for him to lay
his hand on the bridle. Then I laughed as if the thing
were a joke, and I gave Zoiloff a look. He understood
it, and began to edge his horse so as to leave room for
me to pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very ridiculous,&#8221; I said to the officer, who had
drawn a little away from me, &#8220;but I suppose there&#8217;s
no help for it; and in any case I shall be glad of some
breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted to be your host,&#8221; he replied,
without a suspicion of my intention; and he called to
one of the men to come and hold my horse.</p>

<p>This made the gap in their rank larger than ever;
and, causing my horse to fidget and strain at the bit,
I suddenly slackened the reins, plunged my heels into
her flanks, and darted away up the hill as fast as she
could gallop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo! She&#8217;s run away with him!&#8221; said Zoiloff;
and he wheeled round and dashed after me.</p>

<p>It was some seconds before the officer realised how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
we had fooled him. Then we heard the order given to
fire after us, and the next instant the report of the guns
rang out, echoing and re-echoing among the crags on
either side of the narrow gorge.</p>

<p>The bullets whistled by me; and, glancing back, I
saw that Zoiloff was following all right. A second
volley was fired, but not until we had already passed
the frontier; and I did not draw rein till I was nearly
to the crest of the hill and within sight of the Servian
station-house over the crest. Then I found that Zoiloff
was not so close to me as he should have been, and I
halted to wait for him. Below him I saw the officer
and two of the men had mounted and were in hot
pursuit.</p>

<p>Zoiloff was leaning forward curiously in the saddle,
sitting very loosely, and his horse could hardly move.
I rode back to him, filled with alarm.</p>

<p>He looked up as I neared, and I saw his face was
bloodless. He tried to wave to me to go forward, but
his hand fell listlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you wounded, friend?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;at least not much. Go on!&#8221; he said, his voice
weak and faint; and his horse was staggering so that
I thought it would fall. Meanwhile the men behind
were coming up quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on to my horse,&#8221; I cried, my heart sick
with pain and fear for him, as I rode to his side and
tried to lift him off. But at that moment his horse
went down heavily, and only with the greatest difficulty
did I save Zoiloff from an ugly fall.</p>

<p>In a moment I dismounted. There was no time
now to mount with him on my horse, so I laid him
under cover of his own fallen animal and turned with
bitter rage in my heart to check the men behind us, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
well as to revenge the hurt of my staunch friend, who
had given himself to save me.</p>

<p>Snatching the carbine from my saddle, I knelt down,
and, firing over the prone horse, I aimed at the foremost
rider, who fell in a huddled mass on to his horse&#8217;s
shoulder and then dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>I was ramming home another cartridge as the other
two halted and took aim. I crouched under shelter of
the horse, and felt him quiver and kick feebly as one
of the bullets plugged into him; and then the men
came dashing forward again.</p>

<p>But not for many strides, for my second shot sent
the officer toppling out of his saddle heavily to the
rough road. I loaded again instantly, for the sight of
Zoiloff&#8217;s death-white face and the thought of his
wound maddened me so that I could have killed a
dozen men in cold blood to avenge him.</p>

<p>The remaining trooper had little stomach for any
further fight, however, and he reined up and stood
irresolute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back, if you care for your life,&#8221; I called to him.
&#8220;We are on Servian ground, and you have no right to
pursue me.&#8221; He was afraid for his own skin to come
on, and yet afraid for duty&#8217;s sake to turn back, and I
saw him open his carbine at the breech to reload.</p>

<p>I did not give him time to do that, however, before
I fired. I missed the man, but struck his weapon,
shattering it in his hand. This was much more convincing
than any words, and, recognising his unarmed
helplessness, he wheeled his horse round and rode off
back down the hill.</p>

<p>I had won; but what a price had the victory cost!</p>

<p>I bent over my wounded friend, my heart sick with
my grief.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>&#8220;Fly!&#8221; he whispered. Wounded sorely as he was,
his thoughts were all for me and none for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need, my dear friend. There&#8217;s no one
to follow us. Can you bear for me to lift you on to my
horse? We&#8217;re safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad. I&#8217;m not hurt much,&#8221; he whispered,
trying to smile.</p>

<p>I lifted him in my arms, and, drawing my horse to a
stone by the side of the road, managed to mount with
him; and then, saving him all in my power from the
jolting of the horse, I walked up the rest of the hill and
over to the Servian station-house.</p>

<p>The men turned out to meet us.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend is sorely wounded,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard the firing, but my orders are not to interfere,&#8221;
said the officer in command.</p>

<p>&#8220;The outrage was committed on Servian territory,&#8221;
I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have strict orders not to cause any trouble with
the Bulgarians just at present,&#8221; he said, as if by way
of apologetic explanation of his not having come to
my aid. &#8220;We don&#8217;t inquire too closely into what is
done east of the station-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you give me a place where my friend can
rest?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked uneasy at the question and hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t he bear any further journey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is badly wounded, sir,&#8221; I returned, with some
indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do better than give him a bed here. My
men shall carry him on a litter down to the village at
the foot of the hill, where there is a priest who knows
something of surgery, and he can get medical aid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As quick as you can, for God&#8217;s sake!&#8221; I said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>Poor Zoiloff had fainted, and lay helpless in my arms,
his head resting on my shoulder.</p>

<p>The men lifted him gently off the horse, the litter
was brought out, and I helped to place him in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I needn&#8217;t ask for his papers,&#8221; said the
officer, as the men moved off.</p>

<p>I showed him my English passport, as clearing the
way for me, and, with a mere glance at it, he returned
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will have better news than I fear of
your friend,&#8221; he said warmly.</p>

<p>I could not answer him; I was too broken with this
new trouble. I followed the mournful little procession,
and I am not ashamed to say that as I watched it
and gazed at the white face in the litter my eyes
were more than once half blinded by tears.</p>

<small>&#8220;GREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Down</span> in that lonely Servian village, nestling beautifully
at the foot of a range of hills, a scene followed,
inexpressibly sad and mournful to me.</p>

<p>We carried Zoiloff to the house of the priest, a man
whose heart was as large as his means were straitened,
and together we laid my poor friend on the low truckle
bed in the barely furnished room. I helped while the
examination of his wounds was made, watching the
priest&#8217;s face with an anxiety that cannot be put in
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did it happen?&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;A gunshot wound somewhere in the back, I fear,&#8221;
I told him.</p>

<p>But there was no need for this explanation, for the
blood guided him to the wound easily enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ball has passed through his body and through
his right lung.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any hope?&#8221; I asked, my own heart answering
the question before it was asked. He shook his
head sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;On this earth none,&#8221; he said. He stopped the
bleeding, which was comparatively slight.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is very little blood,&#8221; I said, hoping against
hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bleeding is internal. No man can save him.
I have done all that can be done. Let us pray for him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>He laid my friend back on the bed with a touch as
deft and gentle as a woman&#8217;s, and kneeling by the
bedside, he began to pray earnestly and fervently, in a
soft voice rich with the rare gem of unaffected sympathy.
Following his example, I knelt on the other
side of the bed, and, with my face buried in my hands,
I tried to follow his prayers through the tumult of my
thronging emotions at the knowledge that this brave,
staunch friend must die, and that it was his friendship
that had cost him his life.</p>

<p>How long the good priest prayed I know not, but
after a time I was conscious that the rich, sweet voice
had ceased, and when I looked up I was alone with my
dying comrade.</p>

<p>I got up from my knees, and placing the one rush
chair by the bed, sat down to watch for the end and
wait lest he should return to consciousness.</p>

<p>A short time later the priest looked in and beckoned
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;The men who carried your friend here are still
waiting; shall I keep them any longer?&#8221; I placed my
purse in his hands to give them what he would, merely
asking him to reward them generously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will he recover consciousness?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It were better not, but he is in God&#8217;s hands,&#8221; he
answered reverently; and I stole back to my chair to
resume my vigil.</p>

<p>He looked already like a dead man, and I had to
hold my ear close to his mouth before I could catch
the faintest sign of his breathing. I felt for the pulse
and could detect no flicker of it, and then I laid my
fingers gently over his heart. The beats were barely
to be discerned. As I drew my hand away I came
upon a secret. A dead flower bound by a wisp of faded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
ribbon was fastened close to his heart, both flower and
ribbon dabbled with his blood.</p>

<p>The sight of the little withered memorial of a dead
passion, so wholly unexpected in one I had found so
hard and stern, affected me deeply. I held it a moment,
wondering what lay behind, and where and who
was the woman whose heart would be stricken by the
blow of his death even as sorely as mine would be.
Then I laid it so that it rested on his faithful heart,
and, taking his hand, sat with it in mine.</p>

<p>The hours passed uncounted by me. Once or twice
the good priest came back to the room, and at length,
when Zoiloff showed no sign of a return to consciousness,
he administered the last rites of the Church. The
sacrament was placed between the nerveless lips, and
the priest and I joined in the solemn ceremonial.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will not last long. I am surprised he is still
alive,&#8221; he said, when the simple, beautiful ceremony
was over. &#8220;God be merciful to him!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the priest left the room I followed and asked
for some brandy, as I thought there might be some
last message Zoiloff might wish to send by me, and I
hoped to rouse a final flicker of strength for the purpose.</p>

<p>I poured a few drops into his mouth with a spoon,
and after a few minutes gave him a second dose. I
detected, as I thought, some signs of a rally of strength,
and gave him more, and sat with his hand in mine and
my eyes on his face and waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zoiloff, Zoiloff, my dear friend!&#8221; I called gently.</p>

<p>To my delight his eyelids quivered slightly, and
after a moment or two they opened and he looked at
me. He recognised me, and his mouth moved as if
to smile, and I felt a slight, very slight, pressure of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
hand. I gave him more of the spirit, and it appeared
to lend him a little strength.</p>

<p>His lips moved as if to speak and his eyes brightened.</p>

<p>I felt his hand move in mine as if he would lift it,
and, guessing his wish, I lifted it to his heart so that
the fingers could feel the little treasure of love
that lay there. His fingers closed over it, and he
smiled again. But his strength would not suffer him
to hold his arm up, so I propped it up, that the hand
might rest on the flower.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you hear me, Zoiloff? Do you know me?&#8221;</p>

<p>His lips moved and his eyes seemed to assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I carry any message for you?&#8221; and I laid my
fingers on the dead flower to show my meaning, and
then bent my ear down to his mouth.</p>

<p>He seemed to make a great effort to speak, and I
caught a struggling of the breath, as I held my own in
the eager strain to listen. But finding he could not
speak I gave him a few drops more of the brandy, now
convinced that he wished to say something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any message, dear friend?&#8221; I asked again,
as I bent down.</p>

<p>There came another pause of effort and then I caught
a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christina&#8217;s,&#8221; and I felt the fingers near his heart
close on the flower.</p>

<p>In an instant the full knowledge of his heroic sacrifice
rushed upon me. He loved Christina; and in the
nobleness of his self-denying love he had given his life
that mine should be saved for her.</p>

<p>I grasped his other hand and held it, as I pressed my
lips to his marble forehead.</p>

<p>Then I saw his lips move again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>&#8220;Leave it,&#8221; and the movement of his fingers near his
heart told me what he meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;On my honour, Zoiloff,&#8221; I said earnestly. &#8220;God
bless you! the staunchest friend man ever had. I
never dreamt of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell her,&#8221; he whispered, trying to shake his
head. Then I felt his hand try to lift mine, and, divining
his wish, I laid mine to his lips, and he kissed it.
This effort exhausted the little reserve of strength, and
with a sigh his eyes closed, and his hand slipped utterly
nerveless and flaccid from mine.</p>

<p>I thought he was gone; but he was not, and when I
held a glass to his lips there was a faint dulling with his
breath. Taking his hand again in mine, I waited for
the end.</p>

<p>He lingered perhaps an hour longer till the twilight
began to gloom the little chamber, and I was hoping
that he would pass away in this peaceful slumber of unconsciousness,
when I heard his breath strengthen suddenly.
He opened his eyes; the fingers on the flower
at his heart tightened into almost a firm clasp; a quiver
shook his body, and raising his head slightly from the
pillow, he cried in a voice strong enough to surprise
and for an instant give me hope:</p>

<p>&#8220;Christina, Chris&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The word was not finished
before the spasm of strength was spent, and he fell back
again with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>He was dead; and I thank God that in the last
struggle of his strong brave soul to escape he had been
comforted by the love which had controlled and impulsed
every act and motive of his life, and which he
had carried locked away from the knowledge of all the
world in the deepest recess of his loyal, noble heart.</p>

<p>If I had treasured him as a friend in his life, I loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
him in his self-denying death; and when I had satisfied
myself that he had really passed, I flung myself on my
knees by his bier and wept like a woman.</p>

<p>The room was dark when I rose from my uncontrollable
passion of grief, and I pressed my lips to his cold
forehead before I drew the sheet over the dead face
and left the room.</p>

<small>THE END</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was with a heavy heart that I mounted my horse
and, accompanied by a guide whom the priest found
for me, set out that night for the railway station to
take the train to Nish. Even the thought that the
morrow would see me with Christina could not at first
relieve the gloom of my sorrow or take from my eyes
the picture of the cold still form of my dead friend,
lying in the sombre bare room in the priest&#8217;s house. I
had left him full instructions for sending on the body
to Nish, and had given him a sum of money which
made him glad with the thought of all the charities he
could dispense among the poor of the village.</p>

<p>But youth is youth and love is love, and as the miles
passed which brought me nearer to Christina the drear
mournfulness of my grief for the dead began to lose its
blackness beneath the glamour of my love for the living.
It was a sad tale I had to carry her after all, and though
in obedience to my comrade&#8217;s dying wish I could tell
her nothing of his love for her, I knew how she would
mourn his loss. But love is selfish; and when at length
I reached Nish my heart was beating fast with the
throbbing of the delicious, delirious knowledge that we
were close together again, with no obstacle to bar the
mutual avowal of our passion, and no need to dread
another parting.</p>

<p>It was far too late when I arrived for me to seek her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
that night, and I myself was so spent with my experiences
of the last thirty hours that I was glad to throw
myself on a bed. Excited though I was, I slept soundly
for some hours, and did not awake until the sun had
long been streaming into my room.</p>

<p>I hurried, of course, to the British Consul for tidings
of Christina. He told me she was staying in his house,
and, at my request, sent at once to tell her I had arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is great news this morning, Mr. Winthrop,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;news that will interest you as much as it has
me. The Russian plot has failed. Thanks largely to
my colleague, the English Consul at Philippopoli, General
Mountkoroff has declared for the Prince, and he is
even at this minute marching on Sofia with the flower
of the Bulgarian army against the traitors who sold
themselves to this Kolfort and Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will the Prince return then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Assuredly he will. The Powers will stand behind
Mountkoroff, and Russia will not venture to
resist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then my friend Lieutenant Spernow will be safe,&#8221;
I said, describing briefly the plight in which I had left
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not have a moment&#8217;s uneasiness. Russian
influence for the moment will decline to zero, and
the Prince&#8217;s friends will be paramount.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you telegraph at once for news of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Willingly;&#8221; and he went at once to give his instructions.
The result was all I could have wished, and
later in the day telegrams arrived from Spernow himself,
saying that both he and Mademoiselle Broumoff
were safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess Christina is ready to receive you,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
said when he came back. &#8220;Will you come with
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>I followed him with heart beating high, and, as if he
understood how matters were, he opened the door of a
room and stood back for me to enter alone.</p>

<p>She had been eagerly watching for my coming, but,
thinking that perhaps the Consul would be with me,
she had put a strong restraint upon herself, and stood
waiting in an attitude of reserve. But the colour mantling
her cheeks, and the bright glow in her eyes, told
me her feelings, and as soon as she saw me enter by
myself she ran to meet me, and with a glad cry threw
herself into my arms with the utter self-abandonment
of love.</p>

<p>It was no moment for speech, and many minutes
passed with nothing more than an exclamation or two
of delight or a few softly breathed words of passion.
All thoughts of the dangers passed, the anxieties still
present, even of my poor dead friend, were lost, and
merged in the ecstasy of holding in my arms the
woman I loved beyond all else on earth, looking into
her eyes glowing with love for me, hearing my name
whispered in her moving voice, and feeling her lips
pressed to mine. It was a moment of love rapture,
and so untellable in any language but that which love
itself speaks.</p>

<p>When at length we drew apart, the first wild rush of
excitement past, and sat hand-locked to talk, I saw how
anxiety and suspense had paled her, and how deeply
she had suffered.</p>

<p>She listened intently to the story of my experiences
since we had parted; and the ebbing and flowing
colour, the passing light and shadow in her eyes, and
the quick catches in her breath told of varied feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
which the recital roused. When I came to the sad
story of poor gallant Zoiloff&#8217;s wound and death, she
was moved to tears of deep and tender regret. But
we were lovers and but just reunited, and the interchange
of sympathies and mutual comfort in this our
first sorrow in common served to awake a fresh chord
in the rhythmic harmony of our love.</p>

<p>For her friend, Mademoiselle Broumoff, she was still
full of tender concern, and it was a cause of rare happiness
that, while we were still together&mdash;for the interview
lasted some hours&mdash;the news came over the wires
telling us that she and Spernow were safe, and coming
post haste to join us at Nish.</p>

<p>There was but one shadow, besides Zoiloff&#8217;s death,
that hovered in the background. The question whether
she would feel it her duty to return to Sofia. I asked
her with some dread.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been thinking of it while we talked, and
since you told me of the turn which matters have
taken,&#8221; she said, her voice low and anxious, as if she
were undecided.</p>

<p>I remembered my despatch to the Foreign Office
urging that support should be given to her. But it
was not in my power to wish that she should go; for I
knew that it might still mean the breaking asunder of
our paths in life.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think, Gerald?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot think on such a subject, I can only fear,&#8221;
I replied in a tone as low and tense as her own. &#8220;I
might lose you then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall the woman or the Princess answer it?&#8221; she
asked, her face all womanly with the light of love.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lover, Christina,&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is answered: my place is here,&#8221; she said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
softly. &#8220;The woman is stronger than the Princess
where you are concerned, Gerald; or should I say
weaker?&#8221; she added, smiling up to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will leave it soon for the wife to decide the
term,&#8221; said I, and the answer brought a vivid blush to
her face. But it pleased her, for she sighed happily as
she let her head sink contentedly on my shoulder.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is six years since the stirring events happened of
which I have just written, sitting at my study table in
my lovely English home. As I lay the pen down and
close my eyes in reverie two memory pictures come
before me. The one black-edged with the gloom of
sorrow and death, the other radiant with the glowing
promise of since realised happiness.</p>

<p>In that far away Servian town the bearers have just
set down a coffin by the side of a freshly-dug grave.
The priest is reading the funeral service; the white-robed
choristers cluster near him; Spernow and I
stand side by side at the foot of the grave listening to
the words as they fall in rhythmic chant from the
priest&#8217;s lips, and thinking of the gallant comrade whose
bones are being lowered to their last resting-place, and
I of the strange secret of his hopeless, noble, self-denying
love that is being buried with him. The final
moment comes. The sturdy bearers lift the coffin and
lower it, and pull up the ropes with a rasp that sounds
like the severing of all hope; the earth is cast down by
the priest and falls clattering on the lid, and the service
goes on to its melancholy finish. The priest pronounces
the last words of prayer and blessing; stands
a moment with covered face in silent prayer, and then
turns away, followed by the little choir. Spernow and
I move forward to take the last look at the coffin&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
long, lingering, memory-fraught look&mdash;and when we in
our turn move sadly away and our eyes meet, I see that
my companion&#8217;s are wet with tears. Poor, brave, noble
Zoiloff, lying in that far away lonely grave!</p>

<p>In the other picture Spernow and I are again among
the chief figures, but not alone now. Nathalie is by
his side, Christina by mine. Again there is the same
priest and the same choir, but we stand in the lofty
chancel of a stately church, and the words are not of
death but of marriage. Around us a small group is
gathered, well-wishers, relatives, and friends, with faces
bright with gladness and tongues eager to burst out
with noisy congratulations and fervent wishes for our
happiness. And when the blessing has been given,
and we lead our brides down the aisle, the mighty
building resounds with the pealing notes of the organ,
and we leave the church through groups of curiously
garbed men and women.</p>

<p>And at that point my reverie is broken by sounds of
children&#8217;s prattle. I look out on to the sunlit lawn to
where Christina is kneeling and listening with a smile
to the cheery chatter of our two children. All is
warmth, peace, love, and rest in my English life now;
and, as I glance at my dear ones, I thank Heaven with
fervent gratitude that they are not destined to aspire
to the dangerous splendour and evanescent glory of a
minor Throne. I get up quietly, and stepping through
the window into the sunlight, am hailed with a cry and
rush of delight from my little darlings and a welcome
of love light from the eyes of my beautiful wife.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
